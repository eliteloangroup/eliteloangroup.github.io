      <h3>Borrowing Process</h3>
      <p>If your Application is accepted you will be provided with a summary of the terms of the Loan Request (the <b>“Loan Terms”</b>), which Loop Funding, if accepted, will publish as a Loan Request Page, together along with the following documents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the loan agreement to be entered into by the borrower (<b>“Borrower”</b>) and Loop Funding and the Guarantor(s), if any, (the <b>“Loan Agreement”</b>);</li>
        <li>the security agreement, if any, to be granted by the Borrower in favour of Loop Funding on all or certain of the Borrower’s assets described in the security agreement (the <b>“Security Agreement”</b>);</li>
        <li>one or more guarantees, if any, (each a <b>“Guarantee”</b>) to be signed by guarantors (each a <b>“Guarantor”</b>); and</li>
        <li>a pre-authorized debit agreement (the <b>“PAD Agreement”</b>) pursuant to which the loan repayments will be debited from the Deposit Account by Loop Funding.</li>
        <li>The Loan Agreement, the PAD Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Guarantee(s) are collectively referred to as the <b>“Loan Documents”</b>.  In the event of any conflict between the Loan Documents and the Loan Terms, the Loan Documents will govern.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Loan Terms include the principal amount of the loan, which may be less than the amount requested by the Borrower, the interest rate, the term, the fees payable to Loop Funding and the amount of the monthly repayments.</p>
      <p>The Borrower has <b>7 days</b> from the receipt of the Loan Documents to review, sign and return them. They should be read carefully, and legal advice should be sought, to ensure you fully understand the consequences of executing each of the Loan Documents. You represent and warrant that there has been no undue influence brought to bear on any Guarantor to execute a Guarantee.</p>
      <p>A bank statement for the Deposit Account must be provided.</p>
      <p>You may sign the Loan Documents using your electronic signature and submit them to Loop Funding. If you do not submit the Loan Documents within 7 days of receipt, the Loan Request may be cancelled at Loop Funding’s sole discretion.</p>
      <p>Once we have received the executed Loan Documents, a Loan Request Page with some or all of the Materials will be displayed on Lending Loop and available to Lenders and Users. </p>
      <p>Once a Borrower’s Loan Request Page is displayed, Lenders will be able to commit to purchase payment dependent notes issued by Loop Funding corresponding to the Borrower’s Loan Request (<b>“Corresponding Notes”</b>). The Borrower’s Loan Request will be funded solely with the proceeds of the sale of Corresponding Notes and a loan will only be extended to the Borrower by Loop Funding if and when the Borrower’s Loan Request will have received commitments in aggregate to purchase Corresponding Notes equal to the amount of the Borrower’s Loan Request (or such lesser amount that the Borrower agrees to) and thereby will be deemed “fully funded”.</p>
      <p>The acceptance of commitments of Corresponding Notes for a Loan Request will end on the earlier of (a) when the Loan Request is fully funded or (b) the 30th day after the Loan Request Page was first displayed on Lending Loop (the <b>“Funding Period”</b>). Loop Funding may extend the Funding Period for any Loan Request at any time at its sole discretion.</p>
      <p>IF AND WHEN YOUR LOAN REQUEST IS FULLY FUNDED YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.</p>
      <p><b>You may opt out of the borrowing process at any time before your Loan Request prior to the expiry of the Funding Period by contacting Loop Funding.  If you elect to opt out of the borrowing process, the Loan Documents will be null and void.</b></p>
      <p>If you become aware that the information displayed on your Loan Request Page may contain inaccurate, false or misleading information, please notify Loop Funding. A representative of Loop Funding will make reasonable efforts to correct the Loan Request Page. Please note, however, that once a loan is fully funded, the Loan Terms may not be altered.</p>
      <h3>Fully Funded Loan Requests</h3>
      <p>If and when a Borrower’s Loan Request has been fully funded:</p>
      <p>Loop Funding will;</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><p>provide the Borrower with a repayment schedule (the <b>“Repayment Schedule”</b>) of the loan repayments to be debited in accordance with the PAD Agreement; and</p></li>
        <li><p>disburse the principal amount of the loan, net of Loop Funding’s origination fee (the <b>“Origination Fee”</b>) to the Deposit Account (the net amount being the <b>“Loan Proceeds”</b>). Please note that it may take up to three (3) business days for the Loan Proceeds to be available in the Deposit Account.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Interest</h3>
      <p>Interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Loan Proceeds from the date they are made available to the Borrower until the loan is repaid in full.</p>
      <h3>Payments</h3>
      <p>Pursuant to the PAD Agreement, you acknowledge that Loop Funding will debit the monthly payments indicated in the Repayment Schedule from the Deposit Account. <b>Loop Funding may and will debit each monthly payment amount due up to four (4) business days before the date specified in the Repayment Schedule (each a “Repayment Date”)</b> The Repayment Schedule may be viewed in the “Payments” section of your account on the borrowing section of Lending Loop.</p>
      <p>You hereby represent and warrant that you will hold sufficient funds in the Deposit Account four (4) business days prior to each Repayment Date to fund the applicable monthly repayment. You will be responsible for any fees and damages incurred by Loop Funding as a result of any breach of this obligation, including but not limited to bank charges and collections costs. In the event the Deposit Account does not hold funds as aforesaid, Loop Funding will request, by email, that you make the required funds available in the Deposit Account and promptly confirm that such funds are available.</p>
      <p>To ensure prompt collection of monies due and payable at all times, including any repayment, Loop Funding may and will take the measures it deems necessary and appropriate to recover said amounts. Such measures may include retaining the services of a debt collection agency to assist Loop Funding in the collection of said amounts.</p>
      <p>You understand that missed monthly payments which are not rectified within seven (7) business days of notice being sent to you by Loop Funding are subject to a late payment fee as described under the heading “Fees” below.</p>
      <p>The Borrower may repay the Loan Proceeds in full at any time without penalty provided that it repays such amount, together with all interest accrued until the date or repayment and any and all other outstanding fees and expenses, as may be applicable.</p>
      <p>If at any time you believe that the Borrower may not be able to make one or more scheduled monthly payment(s), please contact Loop Funding immediately. Loop Funding may at its sole and unfettered discretion, enter into an alternative payment arrangement.</p>
      <p>Loop Funding may be contacted by telephone at 1 (888) 223-5667 or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:borrowers@lendingloop.ca">borrowers@lendingloop.ca</a>.</p>

Origination fees that we customarily charge are listed on the Site and are subject to change without notice.</p>
      <p>Missed payments which are not rectified within seven (7) business days of a returned repayment notification from Loop Funding are subject to a late payment fee, which is equal to 15% of the outstanding loan payments in arrears, and is immediately due and payable to Loop Funding.</p>
      <p>In each and every instance where a loan payment withdrawal is denied, refused or not acted upon by the Borrower’s financial institution, the Borrower will be subject to a not sufficient funds fee of up to $50.00.</p>
      <p>In each and every instance where a loan payment or other payment is sent to Loop Funding via wire transfer, the Borrower will be subject to an incoming wire fee of $50.00.</p>
      <p>You hereby agree, for and on behalf of the Borrower, that Loop Funding may debit an outstanding late payment fee, not sufficient funds fee or incoming wire fee at any time at its sole discretion from the Deposit Account.</p>
      <p>Loop Funding may and will charge you additional fees to cover collection expenses, litigation costs, as well as any other fees, costs or expenses incurred by or charged to Loop Funding by any third party, including affiliated entities, in the course of protecting its rights and interests.</p>
      <h3>Security and Guarantees</h3>
      <p>Each Borrower shall grant in favour of Loop Funding, or a permitted assignee, a security interest on all, or certain, of its assets described in the Security Agreement (the <b>“Security”</b>) and/or shall arrange for the provision of a Guarantee(s) from Guarantor(s) acceptable to Loop Funding.

        <h3>Lending Process</h3>
        <h3>General Lending Process</h3>
        <p>Loop Securities will inform you by email that have been you are accepted as a Lender and you will have full access to the lending section of the Site when logging into your account, provided that you hold funds in your Lending Loop account, as explained below.</p>
        <p>On the lending section of the Site, you will have the opportunity to commit to purchase Notes. Notes are issued in series and each series (and each Note within such series) is issued in connection with a corresponding Loan Request.  Loop Funding’s obligations with respect to a specific series of Notes is exclusively dependent on repayment of the corresponding Borrower Loan. Loop Funding and its affiliates have no obligation to make any payments with respect of any series of Notes unless, and only to the extent that, Loop Funding receives repayments under the corresponding Borrower Loan.</p>
        <p>You will be able to browse through Loan Request Pages and view all of the information displayed on such pages, including, but not limited to, financial information regarding the Loan Requests.</p>
        <p>To commit to purchasing a Note pertaining to a specific Loan Request, you first will need to have sufficient available funds in your Lending Loop account.  Notes are available for purchase in $25 increments.</p>
        <p>You must transfer at least $200 to your Lending Loop account before we will consider accepting you as a Lender. To transfer funds into your Lending Loop account after becoming a Lender simply follow the steps described in the section titled “Add Funds” in your Lending Loop account. For more information please refer to the section titled “Transfer of Funds” below.</p>
        <p>Lenders are not required to hold a minimum amount in their Lending Loop account. If you do not have at least $25 in your Lending Loop account or if you have not made any commitments to purchase notes for more than 30 days, Loop Securities may restrict or terminate your Lending Loop account without notice.</p>
        <p>Funds held in your Lending Loop account are held by Loop Securities in trust in an account with a Canadian financial institution (the <b>“Account”</b>), until a) withdrawn by you, or b) transferred by Loop Securities to a Deposit Account to settle your commitment to acquire a Note. <b>No interest is paid to you on money held in your Lending Loop account and you are not required to hold a minimum amount in your Lending Loop account. By becoming a Lender, you consent to Loop Securities receiving and retaining any Interest earned on the Account.</b></p> 
        <p>To commit to purchase a Note with regard to a specific Loan Request simply click on the “invest” button on the applicable Loan Request Page and enter the amount you wish to commit. The minimum amount of a commitment is $25.  Various restrictions on the amount you may invest in a single series of Notes may apply.</p>
        <p>Before committing to purchase a Note, you must read the offering memorandum (the <b>“Offering Memorandum”</b>) and posting supplement (the <b>“Posting Supplement”</b>) prepared by Loop Funding in connection with the issuance of the Note. The Offering Memorandum and Posting Supplement pertaining to a specific Note will be accessible from the applicable Loan Request Page corresponding to the series of Notes. Please read the Offering Memorandum and the Posting Supplement carefully and take the appropriate amount of time needed to ensure you understand its content and seek legal or other advice, if necessary, to ensure you fully understand the consequences of committing to purchase the Note. You may, and Loop Securities encourages you to, save or print a copy of the Offering Memorandum and the Posting Supplement for your files and for further review before committing to purchase a Note.  In the event of any conflict between the Terms and an Offering Memorandum (or a Posting Supplement) the latter will govern.</p>
        <p>Note purchase commitments may be accepted by Loop Funding in connection with a Loan Request until the earlier of (a) the time the Loan Request becomes fully funded, and (b) the 30th day from the day the Loan Request was first posted on the Site (the <b>“Loan Request Expiry Date”</b>).  Loop Funding Inc. may with the approval of the Borrower, reduce the amount of the Loan Request and/or extend, at its sole discretion, the Loan Request Expiry Date by up to 15 days. Loop Securities will notify you by email of the details of any extension of a Loan Request Expiry Date that exceeds 15 days in connection with a Loan Request to which you have submitted a Note purchase commitment for which you will then be provided with an option to revoke your commitment.  After you have acknowledged reviewing the Offering Memorandum and the Posting Supplement with regard to a specific Note, you may, by clicking the “invest” button commit to purchase a Note in an amount you have selected and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions set forth under the note purchase agreement entered into at the opening of your Lender account (the <b>“Note Purchase Agreement”</b>). If your commitment to purchase a Note is accepted, the amount you committed will be added to the aggregate amount of the funds committed to the Loan Request, as indicated on the Loan Request Page.</p>
        <p>You understand that clicking on the “invest” button does not automatically confirm acceptance of your commitment to purchase a Note, nor does it grant you any right of priority over the commitment of any other Lender. It is only once your commitment to purchase the Note is received and accepted that your commitment will be deemed committed to the specific Loan Request. Accordingly, you understand that other Lenders could commit to purchase a Note simultaneously with you and that this could result in either (i) the amount you wished to commit being greater than the amount of the Loan Request available to be funded, or (ii) the Loan Request becoming fully funded, in which case your commitment would be rejected.  You understand that in such circumstances, you will have no recourse against Loop Entities, the Borrower or any other person with respect to the rejection of your commitment to purchase.  If the amount you wished to commit is greater than the amount of the Loan Request available to be funded, you will be redirected to the Loan Request Page which will have been updated and you may choose to commit a lesser amount.</p>
        <p><b>Subject to applicable securities laws, all Note purchase commitments are final. Once your commitment is submitted you may revoke your commitment only as provided for under applicable securities laws. You will be able to view the amount committed to each Loan Request in your Lending Loop account under the “Commitments” category, but you will not be able to use such amount to make other commitments or any other purpose.</b></p>
        <p><b>In the event a prospective Borrower fails to comply with closing requirements applicable to the Loan Request, your commitment will be cancelled, and the amount committed will be made available in your Lending Loop account as “Available Funds”. Once a Loan Request is fully funded and closes, the funds you have committed will be deducted from your Lending Loop account and the amount of your commitment will be transferred from “Commitments” to the “Total Commitments”.</b></p>
        <h3>Auto-Lend</h3>
        <p>An automated commitment service (<b>“Auto-Lend”</b>) can be chosen by Lenders.  A Lender selecting Auto-Lend commits to purchase Notes (each an <b>“Auto-Lend Commitment”</b>) corresponding to all Loan Requests that meet parameters that the Lender selects or as described on the Site and selects the denomination of each such Note (their <b>“Auto-Lend Preferences”</b>).  When a Loan Request a) conforms to a Lender’s Auto-Lend Preferences is posted and b) provided that there are sufficient funds in the Lender’s Lending Loop account (collectively referred to as an <b>“Auto-Lend Order”</b>), Auto-Lend will automatically make a Note purchase commitment on behalf of the Lender.</p>    
        <p>Where the aggregate Auto-Lend Commitments with respect of a Loan Request exceed the amount of such Request, Auto-Lend will randomly accept Auto-Lend Commitments which in aggregate do not exceed the value of the Loan Request and accept the selected Auto-Loan Commitments.</p>
        <p>Posting Supplements will be immediately delivered to the “Commitments” section of your Lending Loop Account for each Auto-Lend Commitment made on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Each and every Lender may choose to use Auto-Lend and may choose to terminate use of Auto-Lend or change Auto-Lend Preferences at any time.</p>
        <h3>Repayments</h3>
        <p>Loop Funding credits repayments received from a Borrower with regard to the applicable series of Notes on a pro-rata basis to all Lenders holding such Notes to their respective Lending Loop accounts. You can view the amounts and scheduled credit dates of the payments for the Notes under “Note Payments” on the home page of your Lending Loop account.</p>
        <p>All amounts will be credited to your Lending Loop account without deduction of income tax.  It is your responsibility to ensure proper payment for any income or other applicable taxes in all applicable jurisdictions. Loop Funding will, where required by law, provide you with a T5 - Statement of Investment Income, which will be made available through your Lending Loop account. Loop Securities will notify you by email when the Statement is available.</p>
        <p>Loop Funding may collect amounts due from Borrowers up to three (3) business days before the date on which such payments are due. Loop Funding undertakes to use reasonable efforts to ensure that amounts received with respect of Borrower Loans are credited to the Lending Loop accounts of the applicable Lenders promptly. However, Loop Securities and Loop Funding make no representation or warranty that any amounts will be credited to the Lenders’ accounts or as to the exact date on which such amounts will be credited. Various factors may influence the date funds are credited and/or the actual credit of the funds itself. Such factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the Borrower defaulting from its obligations under its Borrower Loan (ii) delays in transfers of funds between the financial institutions where Borrowers, Loop Funding and Loop Securities have their respective accounts.</p>
        <p>The amount credited to each Lender’s Lending Loop account includes the principal and interest received to which the Lender is entitled. The applicable interest rate will be the rate indicated on the Note less the Lender’s Fee. <b>You understand that neither Loop Securities nor Loop Funding make any representation or warranty to the effect that any Borrower will repay its Borrower Loans. You understand that you may not receive any interest on any of your Notes and that you may lose all of your investment in a Note. Only Lenders who can bear and are comfortable with the loss of their entire investment in Notes should commit to purchase Notes.</b></p>
        <p>You understand that Borrowers have the right to repay the outstanding principal of their loan together with accrued interest in full at any time without penalty (the <b>“Repayment Amount”</b>) and that, Loop Funding will, in such event, pay the Repayment Amount on a pro-rata basis to applicable Lenders and you will only be entitled to your pro-rata share of the Repayment Amount. </p>
        <p>Amounts received in your Lending Loop account can either be (i) transferred to the deposit account linked to your Lending Loop account or (ii) used to purchase other Notes in connection with other Loan Requests.</p>
        <h3>Transfer of Funds</h3>
        <p>To transfer funds to your Lending Loop account, please visit the section titled “Add Funds” in your Lending Loop account and follow the indicated steps. To transfer funds out of your Lending Loop account, please visit the section titled “Transactions” in your Lending Loop account and follow the withdrawal request process. Please note that you may however only withdraw funds in excess of the aggregate amount of the funds you have committed to purchase Notes.</p>
        <p>You may only transfer funds between your Lending Loop account and an authorized deposit account (<b>“Authorized Deposit Account”</b>). Loop Securities will only authorize transfers of funds to deposit accounts with Canadian financial institutions held in your name. The deposit account indicated in your User Registration will be set as your Authorized Deposit Account by default.</p>
        <p>You may request that a different account be your Authorized Deposit Account at any time by following the steps indicated on the section of your Lending Loop account titled “Add Funds”. Once submitted, Loop Securities will typically review your request within 2 business days, and if accepted, notify you by email when the change will be effective.</p>
        <h3>Fees</h3>
        <p>Loop Securities does not charge a fee to Users to become or remain Lenders.</p>
        <p>Loop Funding charges a fee amounting to an annualized rate of 1.5% of the outstanding principal under a Note (the <b>“Lender’s Fee”</b>) of each repayment received by Loop Funding. The Lender’s Fee is deducted from each repayment.</p>
        <p>The section titled “Note Payments” on the home page of your Lending Loop account sets out the amounts scheduled to be credited to your account prior to the deduction of the Lender’s Fee in the normal course.</p> 
        <p>The section titled “Loan Transactions” displays the full amounts credited to your account with regard to payments received for the Notes you own.</p>
        <p>Please note that Loop Funding is entitled to reduce the amount payable under the terms of a Note where Loop Funding undertakes collection efforts in order to collect on the Borrower Loan to which a Note corresponds. Such reduction may go up to 35% of the amount recovered if a collection action must be taken with respect to a Borrower Loan. Loop Funding does not charge a collection fee if no payments are collected, and no collection fee will be charged in excess of the amount recovered.</p>
        <p>Where a deposit to a Lender’s Lending Loop Account is denied or refused by the Lender’s financial institution, Loop Securities may, at its discretion, charge the Lender a non-sufficient funds fee (<b>“NSF Fee”</b>) of up to $50.00.</p>
        <p>Where a deposit to a Lender’s Lending Loop Account is received by other means, such as wire transfers or bill payment service, Loop Securities may, at its discretion, charge the Lender a funds transfer fee (<b>“Funds Transfer Fee”</b>) of up to $25.00.</p>
        <p>In order to recover an NSF Fee charged to a Lender, Loop Securities, may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Debit funds from the Lender’s Lending Loop account;</li>
          <li>Retain Borrower Note Payments that the Lender would otherwise be entitled to receive; or</li>
          <li>Restrict the Lender’s use of the Site until an NSF Fee is paid.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Where no transactions have taken place in a Lender’s account (e.g. acquired a Note,  deposited funds into their Lender’s Account or received a payment on a Note) between January 1 and December 31 in any calendar year, an inactive account fee of up to $50.00 may be charged each year the account is inactive.</p>
        <h3>Events of Default</h3>
        <p>Loop Funding has the power to grant extensions for any monthly repayment with respect to a Borrower Loan, but under no circumstances, will these powers be construed as an obligation for Loop Funding to grant a Borrower any such extension. In addition, if any event of default occurs under the Loan Documents Loop Funding may enforce any security and/or the guarantee and take all the measures it deems reasonably necessary to ensure the collection of the outstanding principal of the loan and the interest thereon and to cover all incurred expenses. You understand that you will not be a party to the agreement under which a Borrower Loan will be extended by Loop Funding, that your contractual relationship will be with Loop Funding alone and that, as a result, you will have no recourse against any Borrower in an event of default.</p>
        <p>If you become aware of any circumstance that could result in a Borrower being or becoming in default of its obligations under a Borrower Loan, you may inform Loop Securities. You are not permitted in any circumstances to directly contact a Borrower. Once your notification is received, Loop Securities will inform Loop Funding of the circumstances and Loop Funding will review the information received. While Loop Funding takes communications from Lenders seriously and carefully reviews them, the filing of a notification alone does not create an obligation of Loop Funding to undertake any action with regard to the Borrower. Loop Funding has complete discretion in determining whether any Borrower is in default of its obligations. <b>You hereby acknowledge that Loop Funding and Loop Securities will not be held liable for any loss or damage incurred by you as a result of its omission to undertake any action with regard to any Borrower.</b></p>
        <h3>No Secondary Market</h3>
        <p><b>You understand that no secondary market for Notes currently exists and that Notes you hold may only be purchased back by Loop Funding, but Loop Funding is not obliged to purchase Notes. Consequently, the Notes are illiquid and you should be prepared to hold them for the term of the Note which ranges from 3 months to 5 years. Your rights and obligations under a Note may not be assigned or transferred to any other party, except as provided under the Offering Memorandum, the Note and the Note Purchase Agreement (“Note Purchase Documents”).

In the event of any conflict the terms and conditions applicable to a specific Referral Program will govern.</p>
        <p>Only parties that are Lenders can make a referral that is subject to a Referral Program (each a <b>“Referring Party”</b>). Any party that is referred (each a <b>“Referred Party”</b>) by a Referring Party;</p>

        <h3>Warning and Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p><b>Loop Entities make no representations or warranties of any kind, either express or implied, regarding any Note or any Borrower Loan.  Lenders have complete control and discretion over whether or not to purchase a Note pertaining to a specific Borrower Loan or select to use Auto-Lend. Nothing any of the Loop Entities does and nothing on the Site is intended to operate or be construed as the provision of advice by any of the Loop Entities to purchase a particular Note.</b></p>
        <p>In addition, you understand that the Loan Grades indicated on the Loan Request Pages are determined by Loop Funding in accordance with internal guidelines using, among others, information from Borrowers in their loan applications and credit reports from Credit Agencies. While Loop Funding considers that Loan Grade adds value to the borrowing and lending process, the determination and provision of borrowers’ Loan Grades are not based on generally recognized principles and are intended to be informative only. <b>You should not make an investment decision in connection with a specific Note by relying solely on a Borrower’s Loan Grade or the ratios or financial information published on a Loan Request Page. You understand that such information may prove to be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the Borrower’s creditworthiness, which may cause you to lose all or part of your investment in any Note.</b></p>
        <p>The financial information published on the Loan Request Pages is not audited in the vast majority of cases, and contains certain measures that are used as indicators of the Borrower’s financial performance. <b>These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and/or securities regulatory authorities and regulators. The computation methods used by Borrowers may vary and therefore may not be comparable. You understand that these measures are for information purposes only and have important limitations as analytical tools.</b></p>
        <p>In addition, certain information provided by Borrowers and contained on Loan Request Pages may represent forward-looking information (<b>“Forward Looking Information”</b>), which may be subject to important assumptions, including the ability of the borrowers to meet their revenue targets; the ability to achieve cost synergies; general industry and economic conditions; their relationship with customers and suppliers; pricing pressures and other competitive factors; and regulatory requirements affecting their businesses. While these assumptions may be reasonable based on information currently available, they may prove to be incorrect.</p>
        <p>Since Forward Looking Information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature it involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to; general economic and business conditions; risks inherent in the business of the Borrowers, including the inability to attract and retain qualified employees; competition; disruptions in business operations; existing governmental regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, governmental regulations; and liability and other claims asserted against the Borrowers.</p>
        <p>Lenders should carefully consider the risk factors related to the Borrowers’ industry and additional factors that could affect their operating results and performance. Lenders are urged to carefully consider such factors before deciding to commit funds to purchase Notes. Loop Entities assume no obligation to publicly update Forward Looking Information to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.</p>
        <p><b>You should form your own opinion on the creditworthiness of any Borrower and undertake your own research, analysis and assessment of each borrower before committing to purchase a Note and, where necessary, seek independent professional advice.</b></p>
        <p>Although Borrowers represent and warrant that the information they provide is true, complete and accurate in all respects, and that such information does not contain information, omissions or misrepresentations likely to affect a Lender’s investment decision, such information could prove to be false, inaccurate or contain misleading information or omissions or misrepresentations. You understand that the Loop Entities make no representation or warranty with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information published on Loan Request Pages or with respect to Loan Grades. Loop Entities disclaim all liability for any such information and for any material supplied by or contained on any external website linked to from a Loan Request Page. You hereby renounce to and give Loop Entities complete and final release and discharge from, and with respect to, any and all claims, rights and recourses, present or future, of any nature or cause whatsoever, directly or indirectly, related to or resulting from your acquisition of any Note, accessing or use of the Site or related to any misrepresentation, omission, inaccurate or misleading information or any material fact presented on any Loan Request Pages.</p>

While Loop Securities Inc. is registered as an exempt market dealer in all the provinces and territories of Canada in which it engages in dealing activities, no securities regulatory authority or regulator has approved or expressed an opinion about any of the Notes.</b></p>

You agree to cooperate with each of the Loop Entities in the contestation of any such claim, action, demand or investigation.</p>
        <p>You agree that the Loop Entities will not be held liable for any Losses which may be caused by any action, decision or order of any securities regulatory authority or regulator and you waive all claims, rights and recourses, present or future, you may have against any of the Loop Entities in relation to any Losses suffered by you as a result of acquiring any Note, including, but not limited to, any Losses and damage related to purchasing any Note, Loop Securities and any affiliated entity thereof having to cease their activities and/or close Lending Loop. You agree to use the lending section of Lending Loop at your own risk.</p>
