								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff">The Ultimate Work/Life Balance Goal: Your Employee and Employer Guide to the Remote Workforce.</span></h1>
<p>Telecommuting and the remote workforce has been growing since technology has begun to transform our lives.  Along with transformations in technology, we’ve seen an adoption of the remote workforce by mainstream employers with a mountain of stats and information that backup the support for telecommuting.  Employee satisfaction, and increased productivity are credited as the largest benefits, the work from home crowd is definitely shifting how we think about going to work.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #ff474a"><strong><a style="color: #ff474a;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.ondeckfinancing.com/remoteworkforce2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download the Full Color PDF Guide Here</a></strong></span></h2>
<p>That could explain why a greater number of U.S. workers now work from home than at any time in history (excluding, of course, any point in time before the Industrial Revolution, when everyone worked from home). Take a look at the growing trend, as shown by a recent <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/184649/telecommuting-work-climbs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a></span></span> poll:<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164611"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164611" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=1131%2C638&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="1131" height="638" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?w=1131&amp;ssl=1 1131w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=1024%2C578&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=399%2C224&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Around the globe, telecommuting is even more popular. PGI&#8217;s <em>Global Telework Survey</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://go.pgi.com/gen-genspec-15telesur-SC1129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms</a></span> what we all suspect: a whoppingly high number of global workers (79 percent of knowledge workers, in fact) are telecommuters. What&#8217;s more, 60 percent of knowledge workers would drop their current gig in a flash if they could work from home full time.</p>

<p>Telecommuting is on the rise, no matter who&#8217;s reporting the stats. Pick your preferred authority: every reputable source from the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span></span> to the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a></span></span> is reporting on this phenomenon.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What&#8217;s the Attraction of Working From Home?</strong></span></h2>
<p>For employees, the reasons for preferring to work from home boil down to a few simple benefits (simple yet overwhelmingly powerful, that is).</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>1. No More Road Rage, Crowded Subways, Traffic Jams&#8230;</strong></span></h3>
<p>The most obvious advantage of telecommuting is no more horrible commute to work. For the more than <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2013/10/ninety-percent-of-americans-drive-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90 percent of Americans</a></span></span> who drive to work, telecommuting represents a total change in lifestyle.</p>

<p><em>A Huge Percentage of Cars Would Disappear From Roads if Telecommuting Really Took Off</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>2. It&#8217;s Cheaper</strong></span></h3>
<p>According to the American Automobile Association&#8217;s fascinating annual <em>Your Driving Costs </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/auto/your-driving-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a></span>, the opportunity cost of commuting has decreased but it&#8217;s still shockingly high.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164631"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164631" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?resize=850%2C425&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="850" height="425" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?w=850&amp;ssl=1 850w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>It costs a lot to commute to work, but that&#8217;s only one of the reasons people love telecommuting.</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>3. It Leaves More Time for Life Outside of Work</strong></span></h3>
<p>When we&#8217;re not spending an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://project.wnyc.org/commute-times-us/embed.html#5.00/42.000/-89.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of 25.4 minutes</a></span></span>  <em>each way </em>on our daily commute to work, there&#8217;s suddenly a whole lot more time in life for&#8230; <em>life. </em>You&#8217;ve heard of the life-work balance? Telecommuting is how you achieve that.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>4. More Time with Friends and Family</strong></span></h3>
<p>We all have friends at work, and enjoy the social gathering, but friends and family are high priority for most anyone.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff474a">More than half of all American families have both parents working.  Reducing the commute, and increasing the time at home saves time, money, and energy and allows more time at home with the family.</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164641"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164641" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=847%2C574&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="847" height="574" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=768%2C520&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are endless socio-political reasons that having a parent at home during childhood is beneficial. It’s good for families and it’s good for society. A 1998 <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1998)49:12%3C1115::AID-ASI7%3E3.0.CO;2-Y/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></span></span> found that workers with children rated the stress reduction of telecommuting higher than those without children. In other words, telecommuting means a <em>lot</em> to parents, as well as to their children of course.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Finally, there are a few economic reasons, too, namely that daycare expenses are chipping away at families&#8217; incomes like a hungry wolf might &#8220;chip away&#8221; at a shank of meat.</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5. You Can Take Care of Things While You Work</strong></span></h3>
<p>Got a leaky faucet? A sick dog? A bad cold? Traditional workers would have to choose whether to take care of life&#8217;s little curve balls or trudge in to work. Telecommuters can do both (without the trudging, of course).</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>6. Your Life is Less Stressful</strong></span></h3>
<p>Unless your home life is riddled with stress points and your job is your only salvation for sanity, working from home will reduce your stress levels significantly. Results from studies vary, but some <strong><em>report as high as 82% of remote workers say their stress levels are reduced because they don&#8217;t commute to work.</em></strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What&#8217;s in it For Employers, Though?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, telecommuting has been linked to an actual increase in productivity.</p>
<p>Stanford University Professor of Economics Nicholas Bloom conducted a huge <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://people.stanford.edu/nbloom/sites/default/files/wfh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telecommuting study</a></span></span> in 2011 and found three very important advantages for employers who chose a remote workforce. We’ll show you even more after telling you about his big three.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>1. Save Space and Overhead</strong></span></h3>
<p>With fewer workers, you have lower overhead costs (slash your pencil budget!). Save on supplies, utilities, and even rent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://remote.co/10-stats-about-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aetna</a></span></span> has anywhere from 14,500 to 35,000 remote workers, allowing them to forgo 2.7 million square feet of office space. The savings? An impressive $78 million! American Express did the same and their savings topped $15 million <em>annually.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco</a></span> started allowing telecommuting and as a result saved $277 million a year. And think of the money you&#8217;ll save in transportation reimbursement.</p>
<p>Plus, since remote employees tend to be more productive and stay longer at their jobs (see the next two reasons), you will save money due to those factors, too. Telework Coalition <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/3-reasons-you-should-let-your-employees-work-remotely-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a></span></span> that the average business saves around $20,000 per year for each individual full-time worker!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>2. Increase Employee Retention</strong></span></h3>
<p>Bloom found that telecommuters were happier with their jobs, and therefore less likely to quit. For employers, that&#8217;s less turnover, which means less time spent training new hires. <em>Cha-ching.</em></p>
<p>A National Institutes of Health <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></span></span> found that telecommuters had higher job satisfaction, better performance, less stress, and as a result, fewer quit their jobs. In fact, some benefits of telecommuting increased as time spent working from home increased. These included such factors as better performance evaluations.</p>
<p>Relationships with co-workers, however, did not improve when telecommuting rates went higher. Nevertheless, the overall effect of allowing workers to work from home seems to be, in study after study, increased job satisfaction and less turnover.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>3. Increase Productivity</strong></span></h3>
<p>Back to Professor Bloom&#8217;s study, which was actually conducted on his own company, a customer service operation in Shanghai. Telecommuters (workers who worked four days from home and one day in the office) were able to handle 15 percent more calls. Overall, they were four percent more productive than their colleagues back  in the office.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the telecommuters also worked 11 percent more hours than their colleagues who slogged into the call center every morning.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Why might this be? Bloom&#8217;s telecommuters:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>took fewer sick days</li>
<li>exercised more</li>
<li>smoked less</li>
<li>took fewer breaks</li>
<li>weren&#8217;t ever late because of commuting issues</li>
<li>were less likely to quit their jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s another case in point: <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automattic</a></span></span>. They are 100% &#8220;distributed&#8221;, which is an insider&#8217;s term for a company with a remote workforce. They run WordPress, one the most-visited websites in the world. Absolutely <em>everyone</em> who works for Automattic does so from home/cafe/wherever&#8230; anyplace but an Automattic office, if there even is such a thing. They&#8217;re hugely successful, and here&#8217;s what their workforce looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164651"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164651" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=864%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="864" height="483" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=399%2C224&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>What a Remote Workforce Looks Like</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>4. Philanthropic Reasons for Telecommuting</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you care enough about the world outside your business to make changes accordingly, then telecommuting makes sense for several philanthropic reasons, too.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Telecommuting is green. </strong>Less commuting means less car driving, which means less pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting opens up opportunities for rural workers.</strong> Hey, you don&#8217;t have to move to New York any more to get the best jobs (or L.A. or San Francisco or Chicago&#8230;)</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting opens up opportunities for those with disabilities. </strong>For anyone with mobility challenges, being part of a remote workforce is a godsend.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a></span></span> published in 2009, Cisco reported that their teleworkers prevented over 47,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas from entering the environment. For the workers, that translated into over $10 million saved annually in fuel costs.</p>
<p>So, now you see how having allowances for a remote workforce becomes an act of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5. You Can Hire the Best, Even if They Don&#8217;t Live Nearby</strong></span></h3>
<p>Here is another reason for employers to love a remote workforce: you can now hire the best employee for the job. You may now expand your search to the outer limits of the earth, if you so desire, in search of the One Perfect Candidate.</p>
<p>No more worrying that you&#8217;ll have to lure someone from another part of the country (or the world, for that matter). You also won&#8217;t have to pay to have a telecommuter relocated. No moving expenses. And telecommuting also eliminates an even bigger worry when hiring from outside your immediate geographical area: all that money spent hiring relocating someone won&#8217;t be wasted if they turn out to be something less than desirable once you&#8217;ve got them there in the office.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>6. You Might Attract More Millennials</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of the majority of businesses interested in attracting, pleasing, and retaining Millennial workers, then offering them the option of working from home is a good move.</p>
<p>A survey by <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.aftercollege.com/cf/2015-annual-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AfterCollege</a></span></span> reveals what most of us know via intuition: over two-thirds of Millennial job seekers say that if an employer offers telecommuting options, they are suddenly way more interested in working for that company.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Challenges:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>What About the Notion of the Workplace as the Hub of Creativity?</strong></span></h3>
<p>Hallway chats are supposedly a trigger of creativity in the workplace.  Is that the reality?</p>
<p>The kind of spontaneous interaction that knits together an organization is what many employers fear will go away if they switch over to remote workforces. How will employees exchange ideas, brainstorm informally, bump into one another for impromptu conversations that lead to great things?</p>
<p>In his <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17396014-the-year-without-pants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a></span></span> <em>The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work</em>, Scott Berkun writes about all the wonderful ways WordPress (which is 100% distributed by the way) encourages creativity in its employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Berkun can report with authority because he actually went and applied for a job (and got one) at WordPress (run by afore-mentioned Automattic) so he could find out how a company that&#8217;s 100% distributed actually works.</p>
<p>He specifically cites that company&#8217;s use of internal blogs and chat rooms to promote collaboration.</p>
<p>Those and other types of in-person serendipitous encounters will undoubtedly change if you adopt a remote workforce, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be at the expense of creativity and productivity. Yes, telecommuting changes the nature of work-related interaction but it does not have to inhibit creativity.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s software for that.</p>
<p>That brings us to the next section of our guide to telecommuting: the tools used to keep everyone in touch and in line.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Solutions:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Tools Are Key</strong></span></h3>
<p>There are a number of fantastic and impressive ways to stay connected, be creative, and share ideas across the web these days, and to cover them all here would not do them all justice. But we&#8217;ll show you a few of the essential concepts to grasp in case you&#8217;re a total newbie to the whole world of telecommuting, cloud-based project management software, and other crucial inventions you may have missed along the way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start by erasing any misconceptions some of you may still have about the right and wrong way telecommuters stay in touch. If there&#8217;s one take-away to this &#8220;Tools&#8221; sections, it&#8217;s that you must move beyond email.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Email- Use Sparingly</strong></span></p>
<p>Email is NOT the telecommuter&#8217;s best friend. It may have been an essential component of the telecommuting dreamscape as imagined by mid-1990s tech geeks planning the remote workforce revolution of the future, but things have changed since then.</p>
<p>Basically, using email to communicate, share documents, and disseminate important information in 2016 is like commuting to work on an ox. It&#8217;s just so terribly clunky and slow, unmanageable an un-nimble that it&#8217;s downright painful to imagine anyone would choose such an outdated form of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">transportation </span>communication. You might as well just go into the office for all the inconvenience and antiquity of using email for doc sharing, organization, and communicating.  There are several great options for collaboration and communication software for the distributed remote workforce.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><em>If you use email to share documents, you might as well start commuting again. In an ox cart.</em></span></h3>
<p>Instead, today&#8217;s real telecommuters use a potent mix of Skype, internal blogs, social media, and chatrooms plus of course project management software to keep things humming along with their remote workforces. Here are a few of the most important tools you should know about.  Some favorites include Hipchat, Slack, Basecamp, and other similar software for a variety of necessary project management and communication tasks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Communicating</strong></span></p>
<p>Facetime, GoToMeeting, and Google Hangouts are great options for staying in touch with remote employees (there are tons more, but those are some of the most common). They&#8217;re all tools which can help managers connect with their teams in efficient ways that keep pathways of communication open. You see a face, you talk in real time, and it’s almost like being in the room with your employees.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Managing Tasks</strong></span></p>
<p>There are countless productivity software packages, many of them cloud-based. One is Asana, and there&#8217;s also BaseCamp, Teamwork, and more, offering the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>calendars</li>
<li>scheduling</li>
<li>Gantt charts</li>
<li>discussions</li>
<li>shareable notes</li>
<li>activity streams</li>
<li>file management</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>webinars, video tutorials, help articles, and user guides</li>
<li>mobile app</li>
<li>milestones</li>
<li>issue management</li>
<li>project pathways and due dates</li>
<li>project prioritization</li>
<li>project timelines</li>
<li>individual team member task lists</li>
<li>reporting</li>
<li>chatting</li>
<li>commenting</li>
<li>assigning tasks</li>
<li>notifications</li>
<li>email integration</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, project management software can be integrated with third-party software packages like Dropbox, Google Apps, Salesforce, and others.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What About Performance Metrics?</strong></span></h2>
<p>For employers, telecommuting employees’ means striking a balance between workers&#8217; autonomy and accountability. Managers can&#8217;t simply measure hours of butts in seats like they used to. They&#8217;re pretty much forced to look purely at productivity, or output.</p>
<p>That can in itself be a boon to efficiency and productivity&#8230; measure that!</p>
<p>One way to do that is using tools like Harvest, which allows for employee time tracking and individual goal-setting. Another component of a successful remote workforce is trust. Productivity is largely a product of motivation, so knowing how to keep your workers happy is one way to see to it that they&#8217;re doing their jobs at home.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>When Telecommuting Might Not Work: Weak Company Culture or Bad Times?</strong></span></h2>
<p>When a business is in trouble, telecommuting may not always be the best idea. At least that was the reasoning behind Yahoo’s Former CEO Marissa Mayer&#8217;s ban on telecommuting in 2013.</p>
<p>Her now-infamous ban was a desperate pitch to shore up morale, improve productivity, and keep the ranks together in the face of impending possible doom.</p>
<p>At the time of Mayer&#8217;s controversial ban, Yahoo was spiraling downwards fast. Part of her solution was to gather the ranks and hunker them down to work under the watchful eye of management. In a statement from Yahoo Human Resources at the time, the reasoning was explained this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff474a"><em>&#8220;To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo, and that starts with physically being together.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><em>-Jackie Reses, Yahoo&#8217;s human resources chief</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, if your company suffers from low morale, weak company culture, or bad management, allowing telecommuting may be a recipe for making a bad situation worse. That wouldn&#8217;t be the fault of telecommuting per se, but rather just more fallout from a bad company scene where dysfunction is just too pervasive to allow for optimal conditions for anything, much less allowing part of the workforce to remain at home for work.</p>
<p>Ms. Mayer may have been totally wrong about workers feeling connected at work, however. A Harvard <span style="color: #0074ff"><u><a style="color: #0074ff" href="https://hbr.org/2012/08/are-you-taking-your-people-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></u></span> found that a surprising 87 percent of workers who worked from home actually felt <em>more</em> connected. Their secret? Video conferencing. They may have also benefited from the fact they weren&#8217;t working for a company that was spiraling down the drain faster than you could say &#8220;Yahoo&#8221;.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Recap</strong></span></h2>
<p>It seems the likelihood of offering your work force the ability to work from home at least part of the week can benefit everyone involved. For all the misgivings about remote workforces, it even seems they work harder to communicate, be productive, and create company culture&#8230; something <em>every</em> company can appreciate.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff474a;">Rev Up Your Work-Life Balance! Get Yourself &amp; Your Business Ready for Summer. </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small businesses, the summer months can be the busiest and most profitable. As demand during the peak summer season increases, you probably find yourself struggling to find a good balance between managing your business and making time to enjoy summer nights with your friends and family. While being a small business owner often can entail working upwards of 50 hours a week, your dedication to your business warrants a few June weekends to yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the summer days get longer, it’s important to find ways to manage your workday so that your days don’t just get longer. </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>Here are some ways to strike a healthy work-life balance during the summer:</b></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;"><b>Organization </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simplest ways to free up time to enjoy the summer is to be organized. While it may seem obvious, some business owners find themselves struggling to manage their workload as peak season demands increase. In order to maintain a smooth operation and maximize your time, it’s important to routinely update your calendar, schedule every meeting, and keep your paperwork orderly. Even if an unexpected meeting or inventory issue arises that demands your immediate attention, </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>creating a detailed day-to-day can help you remain on track and get you out of the office on time; so you can enjoy the summer weather!</b></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;"><b>Time Management </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although organization is integral to <span style="color: #0074ff;"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-101-ebook-take-back-your-time?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=worklifebalance&amp;utm_content=article1">time management</a></span>, delegating responsibilities is also key to successfully managing a healthy work-life balance. Surprisingly, administrative tasks like answering calls and emails often takes up a large portion of a small business owner’s day. Because you wear multiple hats as a small business owner, it’s important to set aside time for these administrative duties in order for you to focus on other aspects of your business. </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>Allot an hour for messages and emails in the afternoon rather than throughout the day and you will find yourself saving time </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that can be better allocated elsewhere. If you find that you need someone managing those communications throughout the day, </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>hiring a seasonal employee</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be another way to help your business get through the intensity of the peak summer season so that you can take a much needed break! </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;"><b>Planning &amp; Preparation</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing in advance for the highs or lows of the summer months can help you strike a better work-life balance when the summer season finally approaches. </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>By reviewing your business’s past performances, you can plan ahead and devise strategies for a smoother and more profitable season</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; and one that frees up some personal time for you! Forecasting your business’s expected performance and drafting a business plan that accounts for past trends can help your small business transition from the off-season to the peak season, or better prepare you for a summer lull. Accounting for possible contingencies like an especially slow season or an unexpected surge in business can ultimately help you strike a healthier work-life balance because you will be better prepared for whatever the summer season holds for your small business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;"><b>Clock-out</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clocking out, both physically and mentally, is important for not only enjoying the summer months but </span><b><span style="color: #00cc99;">remaining positive, stress-free, and focused at work</span></b>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> As a small business owner, you’re probably inundated with new responsibilities daily. While managing a business guarantees a certain degree of stress, it&#8217;s important to take measures to alleviate this workplace stress so that you remain dedicated, passionate, and focused on your small business and its mission. </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>Creating a space away from your business is important</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because reclaiming your weekends or giving yourself at least a portion of the day off allows you to </span><b><span style="color: #00cc99;">recharge</span>, <span style="color: #00cc99;">reconnect </span></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with loved ones and friends, and</span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b> remember </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">why you work as hard as you do. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to check your email on a Saturday, do it once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once at night. </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>Following your passion to become a small business owner shouldn’t come at the cost of your personal life</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; instead, your experiences as an entrepreneur should add </span><span style="color: #00cc99;"><b>new color to your life</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and help you grow as an individual. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes being a small business owner does, however, demand personal sacrifices. A growing business necessitates your time and dedication but it is important to find ways to manage a healthier work-life balance in order to destress and remain motivated. <span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>As June welcomes longer and brighter summer days, see if any of these tips help you strike a better work-life balance!</strong></span></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">Want to Hire a Friend or Thinking of Hiring Relatives? </span></strong></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Here are the Pros and Cons to consider.</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you find yourself apprehensive about hiring a friend or family member, </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>you’re not alone</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It’s common to worry about mixing your personal and professional lives because boundaries can easily become muddled. Before you enter into a business relationship with someone inside your friend or family circle, it’s important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of this decision on your business. While hiring your best friend or sibling doesn’t have to necessarily hinder the success of your small business, it’s a decision that requires you to </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>heavily</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> weigh the pros and cons. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>Benefits</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Friends and family are vital support systems to small businesses</b>.<b> </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">While entrepreneurship is undoubtedly rewarding, it can be an emotionally taxing process. Friends and relatives are often there to offer you their encouragement, help, and loyalty as you build and grow your small business. Because they’ve offered you their support throughout your business’s growth process, your friends or relatives could have the potential to be great employees and colleagues. They know your motivations, your work ethic, and they admire the passion you have for your small business. Hiring someone close to you, then, doesn’t have to be a painstaking process; it can be a seamless transition from best friend to best employee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have hired a friend or sibling because they have the skills you need in your business, you may find that working alongside them puts your relationship to the test; however, you will also probably feel more comfortable entrusting them with certain responsibilities and tasks because of your history with them. </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>Having the loyalty of a friend or family member on your team can even help you as you begin expanding your business and taking on new clients and partnerships</b>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> As your business grows, your responsibilities as a small business owner will grow, too. By hiring someone close to you&#8211;even if it’s your eager niece or nephew!&#8211;you will have a new, trusted employee who can take some weight off of your shoulders so that you can focus on building your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiring a friend or family member can be advantageous not only for you but for your prospective employee as well. Similar to how your friend knows your motivations, it is likely that you’ve become familiar with their strengths and weaknesses. If you are confident that your friend or relative can offer an extra set of hands or a skill-set your business desperately needs, or you know that they are hardworking and have great potential, </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>you can create a position for them that is tailored to their strengths and your needs.</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> If they lack experience but possess an eagerness to learn, hiring them could be beneficial for both your small business and them; however, if your friend or family member </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>doesn’t have the skills needed to add value to your company</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, you probably shouldn’t hire them.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>Drawbacks</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While there are many benefits to hiring a friend or family member, it is important to recognize the drawbacks of mixing the professional with the personal. You may feel compelled to skip the interview process entirely out of loyalty but </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>reviewing your friend or sibling’s qualifications and their ability to fulfill the duties of the role (or their potential to grow into it!) is important</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. If a formal interview seems unnecessary, sitting down and having a conversation about your expectations, your business’s standards, and what they can contribute to your team can be a great way to determine if hiring them could be beneficial to you both. Building a strong team is essential to any business, so you must consider whether or not they are a good fit for your company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have decided to hire a friend or family member, </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>establishing clearly defined boundaries and roles is key</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. You must feel comfortable assuming an authoritative position and delegating responsibilities, offering constructive criticism, and even hearing their suggestions and comments about your business and your leadership. Fundamental to the success of any business is communication, so it is important for both of you to prepare for the changes that come with navigating a professional and personal relationship. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>What Should You Do?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you do choose to hire a friend or relative, it’s important to at least keep these considerations in mind. Conducting a real interview or having a meaningful conversation is integral to the hiring process but many neglect it when it comes to hiring their friends or close relatives. While your loyalty to your loved ones puts you in a difficult position, you must also make the choice that is </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>best for your small business</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Your next new hire should </span><span style="color: #000082"><b>add value</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to your company, regardless of whether your business is a startup, small, or established. Hiring from within your friend or family circle doesn’t have to hinder your business; however, knowing some of the benefits and drawbacks of doing so can help you make the decision that is right for your business.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff">3 Ways to Build Your Online Business with Your Local Community</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being engaged with others within your local community can fuel your small businesses. As a small business owner, your local community might even be the first rung on your customer base ladder. While it may only represent a part of your actual clientele, especially if your business has a growing online community, building a relationship with your brick and mortar customers can create a great foundation for growth. By getting involved with your local community, you can earn its support and loyalty, bringing in business year-round. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000082"><span style="font-weight: 400">Here’s how to s</span><b>trengthen your relationship with your brick and mortar customers</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and</span><b> grow</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> your small business:</span></span></h2>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a">Know Your Local Community:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first step to getting involved with your local community is </span><b>knowing your community.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> While your small business may have a target or niche demographic in mind with the products or services that it offers, it’s important to be aware of your local demographic because the next person that enters your small business could be a new loyal customer, a potential sale, or even a possible brand ambassador for your company. Finding ways to target and appeal to those customers will help you convert them from window-shoppers to regulars. Tailoring your marketing strategies and campaigns to their needs can not only attract a local but make them feel connected to your business and its mission, making them more likely to return to your storefront. Staying attuned to their changing needs can even help you as you begin planning future business initiatives.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a">Get Involved with Your Neighborhood:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing your community prepares you for </span><b>engaging with your community</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you know what your community wants, needs, or feels like it lacks, you can respond by providing the missing product or service. Even if your target customer isn’t in your local community, widening your demographic could bring in new customers and introduce potential profits. You can show your community your willingness to meet their demands in a variety of ways. You can create flyers and post them around the neighborhood, design a sign that promotes a product or service they might be interested in, or host an in-store sale. If your goal is to get your clients engaged beyond the storefront, you can offer locals a surprise discount if they subscribe to your online newsletter or if they add their email to your database. Offering a loyalty program or rewards system for repeat customers can keep you connected with local community members as well. It is important to remain engaged with your local community because they can be your small business’s greatest support system. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a">Build Relationships and Create Trust:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Building a deeper relationship</strong> with your community can play a significant role in the success of your business. Word-of-mouth remains a popular way for knowledge to spread about a business and your small business can benefit from chatter amongst local community members. Spreading awareness at the local level can be a great way to work upward and continue growing your customer base. Showing your customers that you are able to respond to their needs and maintain a relationship with them establishes loyalty and builds trust. If you get involved with your community, they will get involved with you, too. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a small business owner, rallying the support of your local community can help you build a loyal following. Showing your brick and mortar customers that you want to be a bigger part of their community by recognizing their needs and engaging with them can be a great way to create a solid foundation that can help grow your business.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The backbone of any great business is its employees.</h3>
<p><strong>Employees that are motivated are often more productive</strong>, happier, and can be one of your business’s greatest assets, while unmotivated employees can sometimes work against your business. One of the easiest ways to motivate your employees is to create an environment that they want to come back to everyday and showing your employees your dedication to them can motivate them, earn their loyalty, and create a team that is genuinely passionate about your business and its mission, almost as much as you are!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are </span><b>three</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> ways you can motivate your employees and earn their loyalty: </span></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Incentives:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Providing incentives in the form of recognition or rewards is a great way to motivate your employees in the workplace. If your business is a startup or a small business with limited resources, something as simple as creating a “corkboard of success” <strong>featuring employee accomplishments, milestones, or compliments</strong> can boost morale and make your employees feel recognized and valued. Employees that feel their hard work is appreciated are more likely to remain motivated and productive because there is an incentive for them to invest their time and energy into your business. Office perks are another simple way to motivate employees. Having a fully-stocked kitchen that offers pick-me-ups like coffee, tea, and snacks gives employees a place to unwind, stretch their legs, and chat. <strong>Investing in a great company culture can even attract prospective employees</strong> when you decide to expand your business and begin searching for new hires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Offering employees <strong>the option to work from home</strong> if they’re sick, are facing transportation difficulties, or if their babysitter unexpectedly cancels on them is another way to <strong>show your employees that you have their interests at heart</strong>. Recognizing that small everyday things sometimes just happen builds trust between you and your employees and as you look out for their needs, they will do the same for your business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Open Communication:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating an open dialogue with your employees is an<strong> important part of earning their loyalty</strong>. Encouraging your employees to voice their opinions or ask questions shows that you value their input and want to empower them to have a say in your business, which they are a large part of. Hosting monthly or quarterly team meetings is one way to <strong>offer your employees an outlet to express themselves</strong>. It can also be a great place for <strong>highlighting company and employee successes</strong> and developing new strategies for growth based on your team’s suggestions. It’s important to <strong>remain connected</strong> with your employees and scheduling team meetings offers you a chance to get to know your employees on a more personal level. Your employees will feel more respected and, because their voices are being heard, they will be motivated to continue working hard because <strong>they share in the successes of your business</strong>. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Impact:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hosting team meetings is one way to <strong>inspire your employees’ active participation in your business</strong>, showing them that their suggestions can have a real impact on business initiatives and strategies. When your employees feel as if their questions, concerns, and considerations are being taken into account, they remain motivated and loyal. Loyal employees are proud of the businesses they work for and the hard work they produce reflects their passion. Giving your employees <strong>opportunities to work on projects they are interested in</strong> is also a simple way of showing them that their contributions matter and that you value their perspective. If your employees feel like they are making a meaningful impact in your business, <strong>they will be motivated to continue working hard to reach your business’s goals</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0074ff">Because your employees are often the engine that keeps your business running, <strong>it’s important to find ways to keep them both happy and productive</strong>. You can motivate your employees in a variety of ways but <strong>offering them incentives, establishing open communication, and giving them a chance to make meaningful contributions</strong> to your business are some ways you can motivate them to love your company as much as you do.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #0074ff"><strong>As a small business owner, you probably find yourself working upwards of 60 hours a week.</strong> </span></h3>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">Maintaining a healthy work-life balance might seem impossible. But there are many tools to help lighten your workload and ease the stresses that come with growing a successful business. </span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Technology is just one of the many resources at your disposal. Our world is becoming increasingly mobile-friendly, and it is important as a small business owner to adapt and use it to your advantage. Using online tools and programs will not only save you time but, because your customers are online, it’s a way to tap into the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are </span><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>three</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> ways technology can help you better juggle your daily duties as a small business owner: </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000082"><b>Organization</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using an online service like Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar is a great way to use technology to your advantage. <strong>Online calendars offer alerts and reminders, allow you to schedule meetings with team members, and make updating your schedule quick and easy</strong>. The neon post-its hanging off of your desk, monitor, and often sticking to your shoe can be replaced with online post-its that you can simply delete. While keeping an organized online calendar is one great time-saving technique, using spreadsheets and online folders for filing is another. Keeping your original records is undoubtedly important, but those records can easily be turned into digital files and kept forever on your desktop, hard drive, or in an online storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. Bookkeeping, expense reporting, and payroll can be kept orderly in Excel, leaving you with more time to focus on other important tasks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000082"><b>Marketing</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many online tools and programs available to make your marketing campaigns more efficient. Oftentimes when you’ve prepared a larger scale campaign that is set to stream on different channels, it can become difficult to manage all of these campaigns at once. Because of online programs and applications, you no longer have to remind yourself to post content on your business’ social media page; there are online tools that can do that for you. Content schedulers like Buffer or Hootsuite allow you to<strong> schedule posts in advance, leaving you with more time to work</strong> on exciting new projects or campaigns. If you enjoy the hands-on experience of creating marketing materials like brochures, pamphlets, or fliers, you can create your own graphics and interactives in a matter of minutes using online programs like Tableau, <a target="_blank" href="http://visme.co">Visme</a>, or Canva. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000082"><b>Customer Engagement</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most important reasons to get comfortable working online is because that’s where your customers are. Having a social media page for your business is step one; step two is <strong>actively engaging with customers on that page by posting content consistently</strong>. Replying to comments, retweeting posts, or even “liking” things shows your customers that you are available to answer their questions and you value their opinions. As a small business owner, you are in a unique position because you probably already have support from your local community. Now, by also building a welcoming online community, you can continue growing your business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being a small business owner can sometimes be stressful. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when your list of daily responsibilities keeps growing but the number of hours in a day doesn’t. You should check out these online tools for yourself and see if they work for you because something as simple as an online calendar can<strong> help you save valuable time</strong> that could be better spent focusing on other tasks or even relaxing. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Whether we realize it or not, one of the first things we notice about the brands we love is their marketing. Brands can set themselves apart from competitors by investing in <strong>marketing strategies that reflect who they are and what they stand for as a business</strong>. While your brand represents what you value, your marketing is how you communicate those values to your customers.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #000082">If you’re about to launch your business or you’ve been scouting for more cost-effective ways to market your brand, then here are some ideas on how you can market your brand and save at the same time!</span></h2>
<h3 class="p2"><span style="color: #0074ff">Consistency</span></h3>
<p class="p2">As you begin marketing your brand across different media channels, it is important to remain true to your brand voice, even if you’re limited to 140 characters, like on Twitter. Representing yourself and your business honestly across all mediums is one way to build trust between you and your customers and ultimately amass a loyal following without spending a dime. Your brand becomes your customer’s first choice if your marketing strategies reflect who you are and choosing the right strategies for your business is important to building and maintaining that loyalty.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #0074ff">Social Media  </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Social media can be a powerful marketing tool if used correctly. Creating a Facebook page or an account on Instagram or Twitter can be a way for your business to gain more visibility without dipping into your company’s budget. Unlike a traditional marketing strategy that is cost heavy, such as a billboard or a commercial, your business can easily reach a wide audience if you establish a social media presence for it &#8211; and you don’t even need to establish more than one! Investing in just one platform&#8211;Facebook, for example&#8211;helps to humanize your business because it creates a direct relationship between you and your clients. It gives your customers a space to provide feedback, suggestions, and ask questions, and gives you an opportunity to build trust and strengthen your relationships with your customers. The trick to social media is that the more active you are, the more followers you get. So, once you create a page or account for your business, start posting!</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #0074ff">Visual Media</span></h3>
<p class="p1">If you like the visual displays that a billboard or commercial affords but it is out of your budget, you can still create compelling visual media without breaking your bank. There are a myriad of online programs and tools at your disposal that are either free or offer free trials to get your feet wet in the digital editing world. You can test out the Adobe suite with a free monthly trial &#8211; you can create powerful photo galleries, engaging infographics, and even develop new logos. If you find you don’t need the resources offered by Adobe’s Creative Cloud afterwards, you can use Inkscape, Seashore, and Scribus, which are popular free alternatives. Your desire to create interesting and powerful visuals for your marketing should not be hampered by a tight budget. Taking high resolution photos and posting them on social media, using online tools to generate fun infographics for your website, or even using your smartphone to take and edit a content marketing video are all great ways to market your brand in a cost-effective way.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #0074ff">Customer Loyalty</span></h3>
<p class="p1">While establishing a social media presence for your business and creating engaging visuals are important aspects of marketing your company, the easiest way to market your brand without spending a dime is by being genuinely invested in your relationships with your customers. Even if your business is not in the customer service industry, your clients’ happiness should always be at the center of your mission because your customers are what ultimately determine and drive your success. By investing your time and energy into building real relationships with your clients, you can establish a loyal following that maintains itself and grows. Your customers, because they feel connected to your brand and your business, will post online about your business, refer their friends, and continue coming back to you instead of your competitors. Making simple strides to build customer loyalty, like interacting with clients on social media, is one of the best ways to market your brand without stretching your budget.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Planning a marketing strategy doesn’t have to be complicated. The most important thing to remember when creating a business plan or marketing strategy is clarity. Having a clear idea of what you hope to accomplish and laying those ideas out in a direct manner is a necessary part of creating a successful marketing plan.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may often find yourself pulled in various directions about what the right way to approach a marketing plan is. Here is how I have successfully tackled marketing strategies in the past: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first step of any marketing strategy should always be research. Knowing what your customers value is integral to creating a marketing strategy that will interest them and ultimately be successful. Research, however, is not limited to only analyzing your customer’s needs and preferences. It is also important to do research on the competitors in your industry to gauge the success of their own marketing plans. Anytime you approach a marketing strategy, you should try to look at it holistically. Take into account your customers, your competitors, and your business’s own past successes and failures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Identify</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After you’ve researched your customers, considered your competitor’s previous strategies, and evaluated what has and hasn’t worked for your business in the past, you must identify what your customers would want out of a marketing strategy and determine what strategy would suit their needs as well as remain true to your brand. Do you primarily engage with your customers online? Has direct mail been more effective in connecting with customers rather than social media? Is there a strategy you haven’t tried yet but has proven successful by other businesses in your industry? Bring in your skills as a creative thinker to devise a marketing strategy that is unique but fitting to your business, your customers, and your business’s message. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Plan</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Planning is about clarity. If you have a clear objective, you can easily map out a successful marketing strategy. Since you have already researched the current trends in your industry and identified what your customers want out of your marketing, you can begin outlining your path to success. Organizing your thoughts in a strategy sheet is integral to planning, so find a format you are comfortable with. Your marketing plan, if you are continuing to think holistically, should become a narrative that details how your marketing strategy will be implemented from start to finish, and the projected effects it will have on your entire business. Preparing for all outcomes also goes hand-in-hand with planning, so end your strategy sheet with a back-up plan in case you encounter any issues or setbacks. </span></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><b>Execute</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After you’ve mapped out your marketing strategy, it is time to put it into practice! If you have devised a marketing strategy for social media, for example, publish it, monitor your customers’ reactions to it, and begin thinking of future opportunities that could arise out of this marketing plan. You can capitalize on the success of your social media strategy by later creating new content that refers back to it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Measure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Measuring the success of your marketing strategy is about interpretation. There are a variety of ways that you can measure whether or not your customers are responding well to your marketing strategy: visits, clicks, views, inbound links, and shares. In order to determine whether or not your marketing strategy has been successful for your business, you need to interpret the data gathered. Has your business’s website seen a surge in views? Have you noticed more visits to your business? Analyzing the data gathered helps strengthen future marketing strategies because it gives you the opportunity to evaluate what has and hasn’t worked with this strategy so that you can make your next marketing plan even better. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400">The hardest part of planning a marketing strategy is figuring out the proper approach; this brief guide offers you one way to start!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitions of content marketing oftentimes make the strategy sound more daunting than it is. Put simply, content marketing is about a give-and-take relationship between you and your customers: by freely sharing information that your customers will find valuable and relevant, you are offering them real value rather than a sales pitch.  </span></p>
<p>Clouded by all of this content marketing jargon, you may not realize that you already have the skills necessary to be a great content marketer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the </span><b>3 content marketing skills</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you probably use on a daily basis without even knowing it:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1) Creative thinking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step of any content marketing strategy is ideation. To be a successful content marketer, you need to first and foremost be a creative and original thinker. As a small business owner or a potential business owner, you’ve already found yourself to be an ideator. Your inventive thinking led to the Big Idea that launched your business and now you’ve been entrusted with the important task of sharing your knowledge with your customers. Your knowledge and creative thinking skills demonstrate your ability to tackle business and marketing strategies in new ways, which makes you an authority in your specialty. By taking your skills as an ideator into the content marketing realm, your ideas and suggestions can become useful pieces of content for your customers or your audience. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2) Storytelling </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storytelling is essential to content marketing. If you know your audience, you know what kind of content would make a good story to them. Creating content that is interesting and important to your audience is central to content marketing, and the ability to weave that information into a narrative that is accessible and engages your reader from start to finish sets a great content marketer apart from a good one. The goal of great content is to add value to your customers; future profit opportunities will follow as you become a trusted source for information in your industry and your customer base grows. By focusing on creating content that tells a story that interests your audience, you will not only maintain your audience’s loyalty but it will continue to grow. To succeed as a content marketer, you need to be a good storyteller. If you’ve ever told a funny story to a colleague and gotten a few laughs, you’re already halfway there. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3) Adaptability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the media landscape continues to undergo changes, content marketers with a bit of digital savvy have an upperhand. A great content marketer can use their creative problem solving abilities to adapt to new industry changes, i.e. the demand for more interactivity. Interactivity in your content has become non-negotiable &#8211; if you’ve written what you think is an engaging piece of content, push it one step further by including hyperlinks (maybe an inbound link to a relevant piece of content your customers may have missed), an infographic, or a video. Including interactive elements makes the content accessible to a wider demographic with varied interests and also creates more opportunities for measuring the success of the content beyond just clicks and visits. If you’ve been rolling with the media industry’s punches, you’re proving yourself to be a great content marketer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve realized you’ve had these skills on your content marketing toolbelt all along, you can continue creating compelling and valuable content for your audiences and grow your small business. </span></p>
