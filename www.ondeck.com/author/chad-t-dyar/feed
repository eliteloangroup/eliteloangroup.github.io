								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This month, we’re starting a new business book review series by one of OnDeck’s very own, business book guru, Chad Dyar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">For March, we’re talking about how to be a more effective and efficient business owner, so for our kick off book review we’re looking at: </span><b><i>The Five Elements of Effective Thinking </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">by Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This book was recommended to me by my favorite champion of learning, Adam Behrens, OnDeck’s Learning &amp; Development expert. I loved reading this book on effective thinking, and now I often recommend it to friends and colleagues. It was co-authored by mathematics professors who filled the book with examples from their teaching experiences, but it is more than just stories and examples – it is a how-to manual for changing the way you think. It also appealed to my inner Nancy (a la </span><b><i>The Craft</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">) by tying each chapter to a natural element (the fifth element is the element of change).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><b>Earth </b><span style="font-weight: 400">element is the revelation of the powers of deep understanding. The focus of this section is on learning things deeply from their root. As a champion of root-cause analysis, this book came in really handy when it came time to build practical applications. Our mind wants the simplest principles (or a basic outline) when learning something new, but to gain true mastery or understanding we must understand a concept from its root.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><b>Fire</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> element, channeling a trial by fire motif, is leveraging the learnings from failures to achieve future success. Failure is a part of life and this book transforms the way you view and use failures on your journey to success. This chapter frames failure as an experiment that proves one outcome that we now know. We should expect to fail and then mark that failure off the list with a plan never to repeat that mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><b>Air</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> element represents creating questions “out of thin air”. When absorbing new information, if you have no questions then you either completely understand everything or have no interest in learning it. Asking questions should become a habit. Developing or evolving ideas comes from asking a lot of questions and taking ideas in new and interesting directions. Questions allows you to develop new ideas that could open opportunities that you have not yet dreamed of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><b>Water</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> element addresses the “flow” of ideas. Ground breaking ideas are always built on the shoulders of previews breakthroughs. What may seem like fiction (flying cars?) could someday become a reality. The best illustration of this concept comes from the quote attributed to Sir Isaac Newton – “If I have seen further than others it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Understanding the flow of ideas that lead to a breakthrough creates the opportunity for future iterations of breakthrough ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The element of </span><b>Change</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the fifth element which focuses on self-transformation. The basic concept of this inspiring chapter is “be a lifelong learner”. Like an Olympic athlete keeps their body in peak physical condition, a great thinker needs to engage their mind constantly. You must define success for yourself, and then use the elements of effective thinking to create your best path there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each element in </span><b>The Five Elements of Effective Thinking</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> contains practical and proven strategies to help the reader develop better thinking habits. In 2018, I spent most of the year reading books on transformative thinking. </span><b>The Five Elements of Effective Thinking</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> was the quickest read, yet also had the biggest immediate impact of any book I read because of how concise and actionable the content is. This book really puts the focus on being able to create your own success.  I highly recommend this quick read to anyone interested in broadening their mind and becoming a true agent of change.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Helping small businesses is our passion and we are passionate about small businesses. If you ask anyone who works at OnDeck about their favorite small business, they can immediately tell you the business name, location, and why it means so much to them. I grew up in rural South Carolina where both of my grandparents owned small businesses. My Pop (grandpa) owned Anderson Lumber Company and my Nonnie (grandma) owned the Beauty Shop. Like many children and grandchildren of business owners, I grew spending a lot of time in both of those businesses and my first jobs were working there with my family. A lot of my colleagues have similar experiences and several even have their own small businesses. We are deeply invested in the success of the businesses we work and your Loan Advisor will be your personal advocate throughout your relationship with us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of this article is to introduce the benefits of our Loan Advisory program to all current and future business owners and let you know what to expect from your experience with a Loan Advisor on your financing journey.</span></p>
<h3><b>One Team</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Small businesses operate throughout all times zones across the country. To make sure you get the best service possible during hours that work for your business at the right time we have Loan Advisors in NYC and Denver offices. When you need us, someone will be available to speak with you, 6 days a week. We also want to make sure when you need us you are speaking to someone with experience, which is why our Loan Advisors have an average tenure of five years in their role and we make sure to continually train them in all areas from new internal policies to external factors affecting business owners globally. Your loan advisors must demonstrate mastery in competencies like relationship building, financial literacy, product/technical knowledge, and compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our loan advisor teams work closely with our other departments such as underwriting and customer service teams to ensure you are provided with the relevant information you need. We work as one team to make sure we get you the best offer and give you the best experience. We leverage our internal relationships to give you a seamless experience. While you may only ever speak to one person, that person on average works with up to a dozen other people to shepherd you through our process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We work as one team focused on giving you the best possible experience. As we celebrate our company milestones, we relish the opportunity to help you meet yours.</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #83eece;">
			<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“The most important thing to know about me is that I try to treat each of my clients like they are the only client I am ever dealing with – I dedicate my time, efforts, and support to them fully, and never want them to think or know that I’m also communicating with up to 50+other small business owners that day.”  – Anastasia Petrovek, OnDeck Loan Advisor</span></i></p>		</div>
		
<h3><b>White Glove Service</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our main goal is to give our customers impeccable service. How do we do this? We focus on building great relationships with each business owner we work with. We want to learn about your goals in order to help you achieve them. Every time you speak with your loan advisor s/he is focused on understanding the impact of working capital on your business. Our Loan Advisors are your advocates and guides – they set expectations around the process including what kinds of documents you may need to provide, the timeline for getting funded, and how to take advantage of our renewal program. </span><b> </b></p>
