								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff474a;">10 Small Business Questions with Barbara Corcoran</span></h1>
<p>This is my second year working with OnDeck to provide small business owners advice to run their businesses better. Last year, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/barbara-corcoran-answers-your-burning-business-questions?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=relatedarticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbara2&amp;utm_content=article1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 small business owners submitted questions</a></span></strong>, ranging from motivation to competitive advantages, to cash flow. This year, I answered 10 questions from prominent small business blogs and websites, which you can also subscribe to when you’re looking for specific info and direction. I hope their questions and my answers help you be the best business owner you can be.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">1) A growing business needs to be smart about its money. How should small businesses prioritize what to invest in/growth investments?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SalesForce Blog</a></span></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>Every growing business runs short on cash, so you have to be very smart on spending the limited cash you have wisely. You should invest your money only in the things that will directly result in sales, as sales is the lifeblood of every business. Invest your money only in those things that directly result in more sales.</p>
<p>Many young entrepreneurs spend money way too early on expenses that don&#8217;t directly produce sales. Spending money on patents, collateral material, PR agencies and administrative staffing may support sales and generate buzz, but it won&#8217;t bring money in the door. Spending money on smart advertising, direct sales calls and hiring more people who can sell your product or service gets more sales in the door and <span style="color: #0074ff;"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/barbara-corcoran-answers-your-burning-business-questions?utm_source=blog&#038;utm_medium=relatedarticle&#038;utm_campaign=askbarbara2&#038;utm_content=article1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">builds your business</a></span>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">2) How have you overcome personal challenges in your business and what advice do you have for other business owners?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Melinda Emerson, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://succeedasyourownboss.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Succeedasyourownboss.com</a></span></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has personal challenges to overcome, and I’ve had my fair share of challenges, too.</p>
<p>As a kid, I was convinced I was stupid because I couldn&#8217;t learn to read or write in school due to my dyslexia. But my lack of confidence made me overcompensate and over-prepare for everything I do in the business world.</p>
<p>When my business partner and boyfriend left me to marry my secretary he told me, “You’ll never succeed without me!” By saying that he handed me the greatest gift of all, an insult, which gave me the motivation to get back on my feet and the determination to prove him wrong. I’ve found that the key to getting back up is not to feel sorry for yourself. I&#8217;ve noticed the common ground of every successful person I&#8217;ve known is THEY DONT FEEL SORRY FOR THEMSELVES.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">3) What criteria should I consider to determine whether a loan or cash infusion would be a good decision to grow the size of my business?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Mark H. via <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.business.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business.com</a></span></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>That depends on what you&#8217;ll have to give up and if it&#8217;s worth it. There are several criteria to take into consideration, but focusing on the pros and cons of each option is a good place to start. You need to ask yourself – how much money do I really need and am I willing to give up some control to get it? Can the new business I hope to get readily service the debt and if not, what will I have to do then?</p>
<p>Making a list of the real benefits you expect to get and rating each benefit will give you clarity of mind and help you make the right decision. While taking A BUSINESS LOAN allows you to retain your control OF YOUR BUSINESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT SOLD STOCK TO AN INVESTOR, it can also impose financial restrictions on your business. Equity financing can provide relief from any debt service and also give you access to experienced investors, but will cost you equity and control.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">4) What’s the best way for entrepreneurs to demonstrate that they’ve thought through the essential aspects of their business, especially the financials?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Tim Berry, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://bplans.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPlans.com</a></span></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>When pitching a potential investor, it’s important to have a complete understanding of your company’s financials and prospects. The best way to demonstrate this is to become intimately familiar with your financial position – be able to explain your statements inside and out and even more importantly, illustrate the thinking behind the projections.</p>
<p>When you display a command of the financials, it instills a great deal of confidence in potential investors because they feel you will show the same respect and concern for their cash investment, too.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">5) Are there a few rules of thumb you could share with us that would help a small business owner differentiate between good business borrowing vs bad business borrowing?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://fitsmallbusiness.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FitSmallBusiness</a></span></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>Borrowing money can be a sound business decision when done strategically and with discipline. But borrowing money without thinking through the consequences can end in business disaster.</p>
<p>When weighing a decision to take out a loan, ask yourself – is this really a good investment? Is this integral and necessary to growing my business? It’s smart to think through exactly how you expect the company to benefit from the BORROWED cash over the long-term and how likely you are to actually RECEIVE the anticipated benefits. Entrepreneurs by nature are optimistic and tend to overestimate the perceived benefits AND NOTHING is more disheartening for a business owner than PAYING a business loan back WHEN THE MONEY SPENT HASN’T GIVEN YOU THE BENEFITS YOU PLANNED ON. But few things in business are as satisfying as REPAYING the business loan after your business has REAPED THE BENEFITS from the wise use of the cash.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">6) Many small businesses start out as either family-run, or business owners hire family members (for various reasons). What’s your advice on what to do when you have to lay off or fire a family member, and how can you do that and maintain peace?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Rieva Lesonsky, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://smallbizdaily.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmallBizDaily.com</a></span></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>If you need to fire a family member, it won&#8217;t be easy and hoping for SOME peace is not realistic. It’s ALWAYS extremely difficult to fire a family member – believe me, I fired my own mother and she WASN’T AT ALL HAPPY ABOUT IT!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to 1) be certain and resolute in your decision. TAKE ample time to review the situation and make an informed decision, 2) be clear and candid in your communication. Remember THE RELATIVE may not be working for your company anymore, but they’ll still be at your next family reunion. And 3) if you feel it&#8217;s appropriate, offer to help them secure their next position and really mean it. Sincere and dedicated actions go a long way in mending hurt feelings, especially with family members.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">7) Was there any deal you regret investing in, even if you made some money, and why?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Lynda Bekore, <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://smallbizclub.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmallBizClub.com</a></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>There have only been a couple and my regrets are for the same reason. WE WEREN&#8217;T A GOOD MATCH. The entrepreneur has to fit my work and communication style or it WON’T work out for either of us.</p>
<p>I’ve learned from past mistakes and HAVE MADE it a practice to only invest in entrepreneurs I’M certain I’ll work and get along well with. WHEN there&#8217;s genuine trust between us, EVERY challenge gets resolved quickly. But without the trust, EVERYTHING GETS SECOND GUESSED, nothing falls into the right place and nothing substantial REALLY gets done. Trust is the lifeblood of all good partnerships AND WITHOUT TRUST, PARTNERSHIPS WON’T WORK.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">8) How can a mentor help a small business owner and do you, or did you, have a mentor?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://score.org/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORE.org</a></span></span></h4>
<h4><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></h4>
<p>A mentor can be an invaluable resource to a small business owner because they not only provide sound business advice based on personal experience, but they ALSO believe in you AND THAT BOLSTERS your confidence in yourself. But finding a mentor who has experience in your field and is willing to coach you through the hurdles is no easy task because all the smartest people are very busy.</p>
<p>My best mentor was my mother, and I was able to take lessons I learned from her growing up under her wing and apply them to my business on an almost daily basis. I credit her with half my business success. But if you don&#8217;t have a smart mother, then the next best thing is to find a great mentor elsewhere.</p>
<p>FIRST YOU SHOULD identify the smartest people in your field and ask yourself, what you can do for them versus what you want them to do for you! EVERY day someone asks me &#8220;will you be my mentor?&#8221; Hardly an enticing sales pitch, and one I never accept. But if you can figure out some way to offer your free assistance to help the person with something they don&#8217;t have the time to do for themselves or can&#8217;t do for themselves, you can earn their respect AND THEY’LL BE FAR MORE WILLING to mentor you in return.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">9) How do you deal with exiting your business when you have a business partner who isn’t ready?</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Debbie via <a style="color: #333333;" href="http://businessknowhow.com/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BusinessKnowHow.com</a></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165531" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barbara Corcoran for OnDeck Capital" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong></p>
<p>The best way to address this issue is to get out ahead of it by having an honest conversation with your partner at the beginning of your venture. If you both understand the vision each of you have for the business, including the exit strategy you each envision down the road, you&#8217;ll know upfront if you don’t share the same vision and you can put terms in place in the partnership agreement outlining how to deal with such disagreements. You may even learn EARLY you aren’t fit to be partners at all!</p>
<p>But if YOU DIDNT DO THAT at the start of the business, it&#8217;s never too late to have an honest discussion LATER ON. Simply sit down and state your feelings honestly and ask for their help in brainstorming potential solutions. But don&#8217;t do it on the fly amidst the day-to-day workload. Put the time aside in advance and get out of the office to a quiet space with ample time set aside to have a thoughtful conversation. Last, don&#8217;t expect to find a resolution in the first meeting, but make an appointment to resume the conversation a few weeks later.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;">10) Now that I&#8217;ve got a website up and running, what are the top three things I can do to start generating sales leads? </span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;">&#8211; Moe of Big Moe’s BBQ Sauce via <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/?utm_source=ondeckblog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=askbarbaracorcoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoDaddy.com/garage</a></span></span></h4>

<p>Here are three things you can do to start generating sales: <strong>1)</strong> use social media to your advantage; start posting pictures of your product, WITH links to relevant content, etc., THIS IS an effective and cost-friendly way to build company awareness; <strong>2)</strong> get your product into the hands of customers; your customers CAN BE your best advocates as well as a free R&amp;D department – they’ll share your product if they love it and provide feedback on any changes you need to make, and<strong> 3)</strong> become your own best sales rep! Knock on doors (even if they’re virtual), position yourself as an expert in your space by writing blogs, and become the go-to source for relevant info on social media.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of meeting with the three winners of OnDeck’s Seal of Approval Contest. These small business owners won $10,000 courtesy of OnDeck and a one-on-one coaching session with me. Here&#8217;s what Barbara Corcoran shared with them that you can also use as part of taking your business to the next level.</p>
<p>I teamed up with OnDeck, the leader in online lending for small business, because we both care deeply about the success of entrepreneurs and small businesses.</p>
<p>The contest sought to help small businesses overcome one of their biggest hurdles – getting access to capital. Getting capital can be time-intensive and OnDeck provides speedy funding for qualified business owners.</p>
<p>Each winner of the OnDeck Seal of Approval Contest showed ingenuity in their business idea and the drive it takes to get their business to the next level.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Winner: B&#8217;More Organic. PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg</p>
</div>
<p>The first winner I met with was <a target="_blank" href="http://bmoreorganic.com/">B’more Organic</a>’s founder Andrew Buerger who created the company’s organic smoothie using skyr – an Icelandic yogurt packed with protein. I spoke with Andrew and his wife Jennifer about what makes a product or business standout against the competition and when to know if a product or business isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>#1. How to identify a business or products key differentiators and standout from the competition</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to understand and capitalize on what truly makes your product different – in the case of B’more Organic, it’s their use of Icelandic Yogurt. That point of difference needed to have top billing on their packaging to stand apart from the pack, as it was designed their unique difference was lost in the clutter of too many descriptive words. You have to highlight your product’s one BIG difference.</p>
<p><strong>#2. When a small business owner should discontinue a product or close business</strong></p>
<p>If you have tried everything possible to make your business work and it’s still not working for whatever reason, it’s always OK to give up. I gave up on my first business, a flower of the week club, and never looked back. If you’re a great entrepreneur, not every venture you start will be successful and it takes a lot more bravery to own up to it and give up before you waste too much time and energy. Calling it quits means you’re willing to bounce back after being knocked down, and that’s exactly what makes you able to start working on your next, BIG success. <strong> </strong></p>

<p>The second winner I met with was <a target="_blank" href="https://beauandbellelittles.com/">Beau &amp; Belle Littles</a> founders Rachelle and Paul Baron, who developed their product as a swim pants alternative – instead of diapers &#8211; for their young son and quickly turned it into a top-selling product on Amazon. I spoke with Rachelle and Paul about how they can improve their online marketing to drive more sales and ways to keep their customers fully engaged after they make a purchase.</p>
<p><strong>#3. How to improve your marketing online to drive business</strong></p>
<p>Social media is a new business’s best tool – especially with a unique and beautifully designed product like Beau &amp; Belle. Social media is free and can give you instant access to millions of potential customers. Rachel and Paul need to connect with influencers and tastemakers in their space with huge followings to help build their brand. It’s good to share free product for these influencers, and even pay for placement if they have a large enough following.</p>
<p><strong>#4. Ways to keep your customers engaged after they make a purchase</strong></p>
<p>To keep your customers engaged after they make their first purchase, you’ll need a tool for collecting all the emails from customers and visitors to your website. Your mailing list can become the lifeblood of the company, and grandstanding seasonal promotions and new product launches &#8211; offering “first looks” to email subscribers – allows you to remarket to your existing customer base and upsell them on new items and offerings.</p>

</div>
<p>The last winner I met with was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hardballcider.com/">Hardball Cider</a>’s founder Geoffrey Deen, whose love for the game of baseball and real hard cider has since expanded into three varieties of products that can be found in local Pennsylvania bars and baseball stadiums.</p>
<p>I spoke with Geoffrey about how to avoid stagnation and stay one step ahead of his competition.</p>
<p><strong>#5. How to avoid stagnation for your business</strong></p>
<p>To avoid stagnation in your business, you need to constantly find new venues to sell your product. Pushing your business ahead is always found in the relationships you establish with new people. Geoffrey needed to find inventive ways to open new sales channels and get past roadblocks that were holding his business back. That’s key for every entrepreneur. He planned to renegotiate his deal with the existing ballpark contract and buy tap space only for key games. He also planned to fly out to meet and establish a partnership with a whiskey company by the same name. Constantly reaching out for new business is the only way to grow a successful business. For every relationship that doesn’t pan out, an entrepreneur needs to establish two more.</p>
<p><strong>#6. Ways to keep ahead of the competition</strong></p>
<p>You need to find your niche or that special something that sets you apart from the other brands out there. In Geoffrey’s case, the other big players were using concentrate in their cider, so it was important for him to advertise his cider as “craft.” Every entrepreneur needs a unique story to tell about their business, so that their brand can reap the benefits of the narrative. Geoff is a farmer from Pennsylvania, so he needs to leverage his local, hometown farmer mystique to the advantage of his business.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed meeting with the three outstanding Seal of Approval winners and am eager to see how they will each transform their businesses with the $10,000 from OnDeck and my best business advice.</p>
<p>Early in the calendar year is a great time for entrepreneurs to set goals for the coming months! It’s smart to strategically and realistically plan how you want your business to grow in 2017 and determine exactly what you’ll need to get there. It often includes a little extra funding to make your goals a happy reality.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I teamed up with OnDeck to answer your burning business questions. With over 200 entries, the decision was tough, but I picked the top 10 questions that my no-nonsense, straightforward advice can help. Thanks to all the small business owners who participated!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Latisha Sohai, Chef, Health &amp; Wellness</strong><br />
<em>Any suggestions on staying focused and motivated on my business, while working a 9-5? I’m a wife, mother of two, and love what I do but I had to take on a 9-5 position to help at home. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
You have a lot on your plate. Holding a full time job while being a mother of two is hard enough, never mind adding the tremendous challenge of building a business! We all do better with less time if we’re extremely careful about what we focus on. With moms, kids always come first. I use a rating system to prioritize the many things I must attend to at work and home.</p>
<p>I rate my items an A, B, or C (A being the most important) and try to make sure to get all of my As &amp; a few of my Bs done each day. This sort of organization &amp; daily practice helps me stay focused and move my business ahead while still doing a good job as a mom. Last, think about getting another mom as a partner, ideally someone with an opposite skill set to help you build your business. I had my partner Esther and could never have had my family without her.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Kayln Wolf, Digital Media Strategist</strong><br />
<em>Hi Barbara! How do I stay one step ahead of the competition and fight stagnation for my business?</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
Stagnation happens when you’re working too hard, doing too many of the same less enjoyable things at the office, contending with one bad customer or employee that drains you, or you haven’t had a vacation in awhile. When you feel stuck mentally, it’s impossible to move your business ahead so it’s time to take a break, regroup, and get rid of the stuff you don’t like doing. Everyone knows what they don’t like so ask yourself the question, ‘who do I know that could take over this task/responsibility for me?’ There’s always someone, but you need to step back to see it and figure it all out.</p>

<em>Hi Barbara, what are some inexpensive ways to advertise my business and drive traffic to my website? I own a small jewelry Internet business and I’m trying to grow the business, but I need ways to let people know that I exist, outside of my town where most of my customers are from.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
Instagram &amp; Pinterest are free and it’s a great forum to reach a specialized audience. You can highlight your beautiful products and drum up interest with great photography. One of my most successful Shark Tank companies, Grace &amp; Lace, makes sexy knitwear that young women adore and the majority of their sales are online. This year they’ll hit $10 million in sales and they’ve only been in business for 3 years. Take a look at their social media and mimic what they do. Melissa, the designer, is a genius both in fashion and in sales.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Mike Snyder, Quantum Supply </strong><br />
<em>What qualifying questions do you ask that help you decide if someone is being truthful and a good hire?</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
Other than checking the references, which I always forget to do, the best way is to ask the right questions in the interview. I like to ask questions about their mother, father, friends, interests, or anything that has nothing to do with work. These are things that applicants don’t practice where as the usual interview questions people can get pretty good at and can use their answers to create a more favorable and less truthful impression. In short, when you talk shop, people’s guards are up, but when you talk family you’ll usually see the real person.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Jennifer Minkiewicz, Restaurant Owner</strong><em><br />
We have an opportunity to move our restaurant to a better location with more tourist, shoppers, and businesses but we’re afraid of losing our loyal customers. What advice do you have on letting our customers know we’re moving locations without losing them?</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
When your business is doing well, you have no choice but to see how far you can go so moving your little restaurant to a better street with more tourists and shoppers is a smart move! Provided you’re within a 20-minute drive of your old location, you should have no problem keeping your loyal and happy clientele. All you need to do is announce your moving well in advance, ‘Moving to an even happier home on January 1st!’ And every time a loyal customer comes in, give them a gift certificate for dinner for two at your new place. That will get them coming back.</p>

<em>Hi Barbara, I’m a general contractor that’s owned my own company for the last 15 years. I like construction, but my passion lies in real estate … and I have my license. I would love to get your advice on where I should focus my attention – my passion or my construction business (where I’m making money)?<br />
</em><br />
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
Following your passion always makes you happy! I think you can both follow your passion and continue your construction business. Construction and real estate are natural bedfellows. How about you sell real estate and when you locate a neglected property, buy it for yourself, renovate it, and either flip it or rent it to a tenant. Most of the wealth in this country was made through real estate, but very little of it was made through general contracting.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Vidhunesh Krishnan, Small Business Owner</strong><br />
<em>Hi Barbara, does an MBA help at any stage of business?</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
MBA’s are expensive and take time. What you learn in business school gives you a broad picture of business, what works and doesn’t work. It will also land you a good paying job working for someone else, but if you want to be an entrepreneur it’s street smarts &amp; hustle that will take you a lot further than an MBA.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Rachel Ashton, Small Business Owner</strong><br />
<em>When you were a real estate agent just starting out, what was the most successful method of prospecting new leads and how would you change it to fit today’s market?</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
All the best leads in every business come through referrals because the customer is already prejudice towards you and expecting great results because they were recommended by another satisfied customer. So the most successful method of prospecting new leads is getting your last customer to recommend you.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Andrea Mackey, Small Business Owner</strong><br />
<em>How can a small business owner increase a seasonal business during slow times? </em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
Without knowing the nature of your business, it’s a hard one to answer. I suggest you talk to your customers in the busy season and ask them how they spend their time, what they like to do, what services they have a hard time finding in the off season and then try to build a business based off of one of their needs.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146061" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-6.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (6)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Nancy, Sweet Pea Cloth Diapers </strong><br />
<em>Hi Barbara, how do you take your business to the next level without significant cash flow? I feel like I’m struggling to continually grow my business.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146121" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Untitled-design-9.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled design (9)" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <strong>Barbara Corcoran, Entrepreneur and Shark Tank Judge</strong><br />
A shortage of cash is part of every business and it’s a problem that never goes away. That’s the bad news. But the good news is a lack of cash forces you to spend every penny wisely and the best money you’ll spend is on things that directly lead to sales. Anything else is a waste of hard earned dollars.</p>

<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">BJ suffered severe setbacks due to Superstorm Sandy but bounced back introducing her product to hundreds of athletes and gaining increased sales traction throughout 2015.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">I was able to help BJ separate her best sales opportunities from the efforts that would yield poor results. BJ jumps at many of the opportunities that come her way, but it was important for her to prioritize the huge and enthusiastic effort she put into the most critical items.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">The Gents Place – Dallas, TX</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1020860.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108941" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1020860.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="Corcoran_Davis" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1020860.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1020860.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">Entrepreneurs breed entrepreneurs, and that is exactly what Ben Davis, owner of The Gents Place, is looking to do. The Gents Place is a men’s grooming and lifestyle business that offers a modern take on the traditional barber shop. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">Ben’s enthusiasm for his business was obvious the minute we sat down. His wife Lauren was with him, and she was integral to the operation of the business.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">We spent a majority of the time outlining his new business model and getting a better understanding of where he wanted to take it. Ben has three highly successful locations already with a fourth on its way. That gives Ben a proof of concept for expanding the business with a franchise model.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">Franchisees love to examine successful operations before they buy in. I was able to help Ben with some of the franchise selling points and smart strategy; drawing on the franchise experience I have with several of my Shark Tank investments.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">The Sugar Path – Geneva, IL</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1030015.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108961" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1030015.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="Corcoran_Adams_Cater" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1030015.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/P1030015.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">Michelle Adams and Nina Cater are a pair of sisters who were sick of working in corporate America and wanted to use their time to do something that tapped into their passion for baking. They were two of my favorite entrepreneurs to speak with – and the cake and desserts they brought from their bakery, The Sugar Path, certainly helped!</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">Michelle and Nina are looking to expand the business online, so they aren&#8217;t just limited to their brick and mortar store and can sell their product nationwide. I suggested how they could make their branding more prominent on their packaging. Their new products include cakes in small jars and I suggested multiple ways they could merchandise and drive them to market.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">It was such a pleasure meeting the winners. I am so inspired by their resiliency, determination, and thoughtfulness. I wish them every success.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">And I would like to thank OnDeck for allowing me to take part in this fantastic contest and for giving underserved small businesses across the U.S. and Canada a chance to grow and prosper.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif;color: #333333">Make sure to come back over the next three months to see how our winners and their businesses are growing!</span></p>
