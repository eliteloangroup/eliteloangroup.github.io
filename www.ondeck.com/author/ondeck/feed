								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At OnDeck, we value the uniqueness of each and every one of our customers. No two small businesses or business owners are quite alike &#8211; and we strengthened our appreciation of this when our CEO Noah Breslow visited San Francisco, CA-based Leef Smith, owner of <a href="http://www.missioncomicsandart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission: Comics &amp; Art.</a><br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/leef___pic_1_w640.jpeg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/leef___pic_2_w640.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Starting Out: </strong>Leef began his career at Visa and a few technology startups. He always had an interest in the arts, and noticed that there weren’t any quality comic book stores in his San Francisco neighborhood of Mission. It’s a community that <a href="http://missionlocal.org/2013/10/jake-spade-is-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fervently supports local business </a>&#8211; the city recently rallied to protest a big box retailer opening in the area – and won. After he was laid off during the financial crisis, he aggregated his personal savings and credit cards to open Mission: Comics &amp; Arts.</p>
<p><strong>Growing the business</strong>: Leef was able to grow sales 400% in the first few years and developed<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-comics-and-art-san-francisco" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a loyal customer base</a>. His reputation for supporting local artists dovetailed nicely with Mission’s values and personality – a small business owner helping other small business owners was a real differentiator within the community. Over time, purchasing inventory become his biggest obstacle. Leef houses an eclectic mix of over 15,000 unique titles, but needs to order all comics from his distributor two months in advance with seven day payment terms.<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/leef____ic_3_w640.jpeg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/leef___pic_4_w640.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Looking for capital:</strong> Leef needed financing to accommodate his cash flow cycle, and decided to apply for a bank loan from a local credit union. The application process took weeks and was extremely labor intensive – despite having a healthy business, he was ultimately declined and left feeling frustrated. In July of this year, he decided to look online for financing and was introduced to OnDeck through a referral partner. His application process took minutes, he was approved within one day and recieved financing a few days later.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, he was able to purchase the inventory he needed and accommodate all of his customers&#8217; requests. He recently took out a second loan with OnDeck, and is now in an even better position to take advantage of the busy holiday season.</p>
<p><strong>Leef’s Big Lesson:</strong></p>
<p>“When you’re competing with big box and online retailers, the one thing that really sets your business apart is customer service. Know your community, know your customer and know why your business is an enjoyable place to visit.”</p>
<p>If your business is in a similar position to Leef and in need of financing to accommodate cash flow cycles, OnDeck is here to <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help</a>. Our Loan Specialists are available 6-days a week to help small businesses like Leef’s access capital – when they need it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the On Deck Team sat down with the brains behind <a href="http://thankyousmallbusiness.com/" target="_blank">Thank You Small Business </a>– the movement to raise awareness about the impact small businesses have on the national economy. As a big supporter of the grassroots movement, we wanted to share Carissa’s story and let others know how they can get involved.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/carissa_image.jpg" alt="Thank You Small Business - Carissa" /></p>
<p><strong>OD: What inspired you to start “Thank You Small Business”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CR: </strong>As the founder of Silver Lining Ltd (a company that helps small business owners set and hit financial goals with our SLAP methodology), small businesses owners have always been a group of people I am extremely passionate about. About 9 months ago I started writing my 3rd book &#8211; this one teaching the entire general public about how important small business is to the economy. The book is essentially an entire work in support of my belief that we CAN change the economy one small business at a time. As I was writing the book I got really inspired about how important this message is and thought to myself- &#8220;Why just write a book when we could start a campaign?!&#8221;   So, I started reaching out to the small business advocates I knew of – On Deck included – to see how we could turn this idea into a reality. The reception was really positive, and everything just took off from there.</p>
<p><strong>OD: What’s been your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CR: </strong>Everyone is this world is just so beyond busy – small business owners, my partners, my colleagues. There is so much good intention out there, but a lack of adequate time. Figuring out how to be efficient with my time and overcoming some systematic challenges were my biggest obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>OD: What were you most surprised about when getting the movement off the ground?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CR:</strong> It may sound funny, but I was pleasantly surprised by everyone’s reception: it’s been overwhelmingly positive. For anyone who has ever put together something with this many elements and moving parts, you know that you can put months and months into something, and you really never know what’s going to happen. I am constantly amazed at the fact that it is all actually working and that people are engaging in such a significant way. It is getting bigger and better than I had even expected!</p>
<p><strong>OD: How can small business owners get involved?</strong></p>
<p><strong>CR: </strong>There are so many great ways for any small business owner to get involved.  We have free <a href="http://thankyousmallbusiness.com/live-events/ten-city-tour/" target="_blank">live events</a> still coming up in Philadelphia, Dallas, Detroit and Tucson for any small business owners located in those markets.  We have an amazing webinar series with over 20 <a href="http://thankyousmallbusiness.com/live-events/webinars/" target="_blank">free webinars</a> that are being run throughout March and April.   And, we have a completely free <a href="http://thankyousmallbusiness.com/resource-center/" target="_blank">Resource Center</a> that you can access online full of free stuff to help you grow your business.   And more.  It is all outlined and available at <a href="http://thankyousmallbusiness.com/" target="_blank">thankyousmallbusiness.com</a>.  You can also follow us on Twitter and Facebook- using #Tysmallbiz.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week marks an exciting anniversary for On Deck &#8211; 5 years ago we made the first two loans in the history of the company.</p>
<p>The loans were small &#8211; $3,000 to a limousine company and $5,000 to an auto repair shop, but they were the beginning of big things for On Deck.</p>
<p>We quickly outgrew our one room office (we&#8217;re on office #6 right now!) and haven&#8217;t looked back. Today, On Deck growth is accelerating &#8211; we are among the fastest growing companies in the country, have over 100 employees and most importantly the company has delivered over $250 Million to small businesses nationwide.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re proud to have helped fuel the growth of thousands of local businesses run by dedicated owners like Sharon, Scott, Julien and Travis, and we look forward to continuing our mission of delivering capital to growing small businesses across the country!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Tuesday, October 11, 2011 by On Deck</em></p>
<p>This week On Deck is in Chicago for the <a href="http://www.bai.org/retaildelivery/index.aspx" target="_blank">BAI Retail Delivery</a> conference to show how the On Deck technology platform can solve the challenges of delivering capital to Main Street.</p>
<p>Today, President Bill Clinton is giving the keynote speech for the conference. During an address this summer at the Clinton Global Initiative America, he highlighted the problems facing both business owners and the banks that serve them:</p>
<p>&#8220;For at least 40 years its been hard for small businesses to get a loan from a bank.  To be fair to the banks it&#8217;s because the transaction costs of small loans don&#8217;t create much return&#8221;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, On Deck Founder Mitch Jacobs will be presenting with U.S. Bank Senior Vice President Robert Kaufman: &#8220;The Main Street Opportunity: How Technology is Changing Small Business Lending&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to show how the On Deck technology platform is efficiently delivering capital to Main Street, and how its expanded use can make a significant impact on the economic challenges facing the country. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/in-charge/2011/05/11/why-vets-are-likely-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> covers a recent study from the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy suggesting a “strong correlation between military service and self-employment.”  The data shows men and women who served in the armed forces at least 45% more likely to start their own businesses and be self-employed than those with no active-duty experience.  The research shows character traits common to the military – discipline and leadership – are often more important than training, education or culture.</p>
<p>At On Deck, we&#8217;ve been working with a growing number of entrepreneurs with military backgrounds &#8211; including several veterans of Iraq and Afgahnistan who have launched exciting businesses back home. Stay tuned for their stories in our upcoming profiles!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Small Business Champion of the Week: In-N-Out Burger</strong></p>
<p>In celebration of Small Business Month, On Deck will profile savvy, well-recognized companies that all got their start as small entrepreneurial ventures. To kick us off, we’re examining a West Coast Cult Classic: In-N-Out Burger. Founded as a single location in 1948 by husband and wife team Harry and Esther Snyder, the Irvine, California company has grown to 258 restaurants spread throughout<br />
Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Texas.</p>
<p>The Snyder’s founded the company with a simple mission: give customers the freshest, highest quality foods you can buy and provide them with friendly service in a sparkling clean environment.  Then, to differentiate themselves from their competition, they utilized the new idea of a drive-thru with a two-way speaker box.</p>
<p>In-N-Out Burger is renowned for its employee-centered policies, wages significantly above state and federally-mandated minimum wages, as well as an “In-N-Out Burger University” for new hires and management positions. Still family-owned – and with a menu unchanged for over sixty years – Harry and Esther’s only granddaughter Lynsi Martinez now serves as company president.</p>
<p>At On Deck, we congratulate In-N-Out Burger on its many years of success, and encourage all small businesses to look at stories such as this for encouragement and motivation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perry Spoul needed to act fast. As the owner of the Rappanhannock Mattress Company, he had an opportunity to buy a key piece of equipment on the cheap: a $35,000 delivery truck for a mere $17,000. He knew the purchase would bolster his bandwidth and lead to an increase in sales.  A money making opportunity was within reach; however, he didn’t have the cash on hand. That’s when Perry turned to <a href="http://ondeckcapital.com/" target="_blank">On Deck</a> for the capital he needed.</p>
<p>After a quick approval process, Perry received a $30,000 small business loan from On Deck &#8212; less than seven business days from start to finish. He was able to buy the delivery truck, and put the rest towards stocking up on inventory. And On Deck couldn’t be prouder of the outcome.  “Thanks to the money On Deck injected into my business, I’ve been able to grow,” Perry said of his small business loan.</p>
<p>The On Deck Team wishes Rappanhannock Mattress Company continued growth and the best of luck this Spring!</p>
