								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Many small businesses rely on invoicing and extending payment terms to sell to their customers. Sometimes customers don't always pay on time and you've fronted the money which creates a mess for your cash flow. In the article we cover what you can do as a small business owner to get paid as quickly as possible.</p>		</div>
		
<p><em>“Metrics that Matter”</em> <em>is a four-part series designed to deliver a pathway and a practice to the most impassioned small business owners.  The ones that built their companies not because they had a background in business but a passion for delivering the kinds of products and services they clearly saw a need for delivered at a service level that was missing from the marketplace.  This series is designed to empower and elevate you and your team so that you can win the game. </em></p>
<p>Billion-dollar companies started just like your business or mine: with an idea and a founder. Growth comes from a vision, hard work, a solid culture, care for the client or customer and solid financial management.  If this is the magic formula, why isn’t every company successful from the start?  Great question!</p>
<p>Each one of these growth drivers: vision, hard work, corporate culture, care for the customer and solid financial management has a methodology, a formula that has companies operate in a manner that sets them on the path to growth. Let’s unpack the financial management piece and focus on one critical element that will help charter your small business growth from startup to mainstay: Collections.  I know, surprising, right? You might be thinking “what? Not top line revenue?” No, top line revenue keeps you expanding (like the saying, “if you’re not growing, you’re dying”) but what will keep you in business is collecting what’s owed to you in the shortest amount of time with a consistency that yields an almost boring predictability.  I love being bored by money in business. It means that everything is going great. The straight-line path to achieving financial boredom drives right through a company’s policies and procedures around granting credit to customers and the company’s collections process.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the billion-dollar companies for a minute. These companies had great sales that helped them level up to become the massive 800-pound gorilla in the room. Break-thru sales took them from a small business to a medium sized business and then to an enterprise scale company and collecting the money gave them the fuel to help charter next level results. At each jump in revenue, the risk to the business increased. Growing fast seems glamorous from all the media coverage that a rapidly-growing business receives but know it is inherently risky because it eats like a hungry puppy—it needs more because it’s on a growth trajectory. It means that the business has to use more resources up front to deliver its products or services while payments and the amount of on time payments from customers might be in question if credit rules, policies and procedures haven’t been decided upon, clearly stated and agreed to by the people and companies you’re serving.</p>
<p>What is rooted in collections is the assumption of integrity. When I say “integrity” I don’t mean “good or bad” “right or wrong” I’m referencing structural integrity like the foundation of a building. You can’t put the second story of a building on without a solid foundation. Having a foundation in a building is the structural integrity of that building.  Your credit and payment terms are laying out the game of integrity between you and your customers.  When making credit agreements with your customers (i.e. giving them a net 30 account) you are saying to the customer that you trust them to honor the terms of the agreement with the expectation that their business will pay in accordance with the terms presented and recognized. They, in turn, promise to honor this agreement and pay you within the timeframe you all set. This is the foundation of integrity in the relationship. From here you can create your cashflow forecasts because it lays the expectation of payments on work performed as per your arrangements.</p>
<p>What happens when the customer doesn’t maintain their end of the agreement? When they don’t pay on time, there is an impact to your business.  So nice Mr. Smith who always comes into your hardware store and signs for materials with a net 30 agreement becomes “that bum Mr. Smith” when he becomes a perpetual late payer. When you see Mr. Smith in your neighborhood grocery store, he no longer is that “nice Mr. Smith” he is “that bum that owes you $615 for 90 days.” Anyone who has their own business has a Mr. Smith, “that guy” who doesn’t pay on time and its ruined your relationship because you feel like you and your good nature have been taken advantage of. This is because the relationship no longer has that foundation of integrity. So how do you stop this and keep your business on the path of financial integrity? By putting in credit options, financial controls and payment options so that we can take this tiger by the tail and change how you are an aren’t getting paid on time into how you will get paid on time. Here’s the method to follow so that you move from reactively collecting the money that you’re owed to having proactive policies that have you creating a positive cash flow environment.</p>
<p>First, we’ll start with the metric that helps you understand your current state results and how to improve them:</p>
<h3><strong>Days Sales Outstanding</strong></h3>
<p>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is the holy grail of small business financial management because it is the biggest predictor of cashflow and prognosticator of bad debt—the longer an invoice goes uncollected, the more likely a business will not collect it.  Conversely, the more predictable collections are, the greater control you have over managing cash and business expectations. The hardest thing for a business owner to manage is uncertainty. DSO management and analysis helps you understand how much cash you will have for reinvestment or what the profits of the business will be at year’s end.</p>
<p>Controlling your DSO is key to controlling the cash that comes into the business but also holds the line on bad debt. Knowing which customers are paying and when is key to controlling your DSO.   Remember, our goal is predictability. When we can know when and how much we’ll be getting paid, business and finance planning becomes a much easier task.</p>
<h3><strong>Setting Up Credit and Collections Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Setting up the rules of engagement—how customers are going to pay for your products or services is key to your business model and the conditions for your cashflows. Some business customs dictate how your customers will pay.  Diners in a restaurant sit down to a meal, collect a check at the end of the meal, pay the check to the waitstaff and then leave a tip.  There is an implied agreement between diner and restauranteur that payment will happen once the diner is served.  Fast casual dining has you pay when you order and often before you pick up your own food order.  Still the conventions of these kinds of transactions is cultural and implied by industry.  But what if you are a service company: a plumber, a marketing agency, an executive coach or other service provider that may or may not use materials or deliver a product with a service attached? Plumbers who fix a sink faucet bring talent and skills to a repair job but also a small inventory of parts that they’ve already paid for at the plumbing supply house. Should they offer to send an invoice and wait for payment from a new customer? Let’s look at this question: does the plumber know this customer and have a payment history with the customer? Does the plumber have to lay out money to service the customer? Is the plumber replacing broken parts with new parts that s/he paid for and put in inventory? Does the fee for fixing the faucet include administrative time to make an invoice, sending it to the customer, send a reminder notice that the bill is due or any collections fees that it might cost the plumber if s/he needs to hire help to collect the bill. Does the plumber have to offer terms to the customer as part of a customary and implied way of doing business like the restauranteur? No, the plumber isn’t obligated to offer the new customer any credit—the offer of sending an invoice with the hopes that they will be paid in a timely manner is not a requirement in this case. A great cashflow environment is made by devising the rules of the game, setting customer expectations and having those terms be adhered to.</p>
<p>Create the terms that are the safest for you as the business owner.  Collecting payment for services at the time when they’re rendered removes the risk of non-payment. That means there is no credit being offered to the customer for the kinds of one-time services like fixing a leaky faucet. Accepting credit cards and adding the service fees into  your overall pricing will more than pay for itself by your ability to collect your money immediately. If it’s a large job with progress payments, create a payment schedule and method of acceptable terms for payments (credit card, business check, cashier’s check, wire transfers etc…). Don’t assume that the goodwill of the customer will have them stick to your terms. Like my mailman, Robert, always says “making sure you’re keeping honest people honest.” That’s what clear payment terms are along with payment methods.</p>
<h3><strong>Setting customer expectations for payment options</strong></h3>
<p>Pre-determining how your transactions work best for you will help you set expectations for the customer.  You might let the customer know when they set the appointment that services rendered need to be paid for at the time of delivery. You can tell them about the types of payments that you’ll accept from them (cash, credit card, check, PayPal, Square, Venmo etc…). Accepting numerous payment types helps you bridge the gap between what you need to make your business run (cash) and what kinds of payment methods the customer has at their disposal.  Offering payment options helps customers feel comfortable in paying with a method they feel most comfortable with. It also will get you paid. In the past, many small businesses didn’t want to accept credit cards. Understanding that there is a financing fee (per swipe charge, percentage of transaction and perhaps a monthly service charge ) for accepting credit cards and other methods of cash collections like PayPal or Square carry a cost to your business overall, you can factor this cost into your pricing having the customer’s fees pay for the financing charge you will incur for every transaction. This way, the financing charges are already accounted for in your pricing and it doesn’t mean that you’ll be losing margin by using them.</p>
<p>Service providers that deliver a unique and hard to duplicate service like executive coaches bill clients by a retainer method that is outlined in their contract. They often stipulate that the client pays for services before the service is delivered. If payment hasn’t been received by the coaching business as per the contract, the coach isn’t obligated to deliver any services until payment has been rendered. This is a way to ensure that the value of the coach’s time is respected and that they don’t have the risk of not getting paid by a client. Being paid on retainer prior to delivering service means that there is no risk to the business owner—and that’s the kind of safety we like in our transactions.</p>
<h3><strong>Checking references before offering a Net 30 deal to your Customers</strong></h3>
<p>Using an agency like a Dun &amp; Bradstreet isn’t a pathway that most small business owners take and for good reason—the benefits that a small business can derive from the service might not outweigh the fees. So, ask for trade references—your new customer should be able to provide you a few references to check on their payment history. When they give them to you, make sure you follow up and call those references. Tell your customer that once you do a credit check, you can determine if you’ll offer them credit. Once you do check, you will know if you want to offer them credit and if you do, what is the limit that you’ll offer them.  Remember, anytime you offer credit, you will be taking a risk on your customer’s ability to pay. Again, there are some businesses like raw materials suppliers where offering net 30 is the lingua franca of the industry and if this includes you and your business, make certain that you check references and check in with your finance department to know who is paying on time and who is “that guy” who isn’t paying as agreed. Remember, you can always change the terms of your credit outlays if your customer isn’t honoring the payment terms that have been agreed to.</p>
<h3><strong>Offering terms: why net 30 really is net 45 and net 60 is really net 90</strong></h3>
<p>Many small service providers make this start up mistake: offering terms to new customers when they can’t afford to offer terms.  We think offering terms is another way of being polite and is the best way to open doors for new business.  This isn’t the way for a new business owner to limit their risk and make certain they are paid for the work they perform. Only offer terms if you can afford to take the risk of your customers not paying the balance of what they owe you.</p>
<p>Collections situations happen when a customer can’t pay, is paying other vendors or creditors or pushing you down to the bottom of the invoice pile because they’re receiving pressure to pay from other creditors. Some of the best coaching I ever got was from a fellow entrepreneur who told me to tell a very slow paying client that they needed to “disappoint someone else” and to pay me what was owed to my business instead of pushing off our bill for another vendor’s.  I was constantly disappointed by this client’s lack of timely payments—even though they agreed to the payment schedule and had the ability to pay. For whatever reason, this client kept putting our invoice on the bottom of the pile. It would take a threat of ceasing services that then would force the client to pay. We ended up rescinding their credit with the company and put them on an autopay plan using their credit card. In doing so, we removed the risk of non-payment and the cost of our in-house collection efforts from our Accounts Receivable department.</p>
<h3><strong>Accept Credit Cards</strong></h3>
<p>Credit card processing fees are not the best part of accepting credit cards as a form of payment. Getting paid in a timely manner is. To make up for the cost of financing, build in the financing charge into your pricing as discussed in a prior. Yes, the financing costs do add up fast here, however, it removes the burden of collections that you might have to do with a client. Think about how much wasted time you or your finance team spends doing collections—weigh that against accepting credit cards for payments. Credit card fees are looking better, right? Using services like Square and PayPal give your customer other payment options when they don’t want to have to let go of their cash on hand. This might have them buy more products or services from you if they know that they can manage their cashflow.</p>
<h3><strong>What if You’ve Offered Terms and Now You Can’t Collect?</strong></h3>
<p>Using a collection agency as a last ditch effort for small business can be a way to at least recover a small amount of your outlay for a non-paying customer. It means that you’ve tried everything you could to collect the money in-house and now you need outside help.  Working with a collections agency means most businesses have two options in contracting a collection’s company: the first option is giving them anywhere from 30% to 50% of the amount that they can collect from your very late payers. The second option means that you’ve sold this debt for pennies on the dollar in hopes of recovering some of the money that you’ve laid out to deliver the products or services that the customer ordered but for some reason cannot pay for. Determining what’s best for you and your company will be checked on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>No one wants to think about losing the money that you’ve invested in good faith that your customer will pay you for the goods and services that you’ve already delivered.  Let’s think about it in theory. What do you do if there’s been a material change in the condition of the customer’s business? By material change we mean that when you offered them terms the business was humming along, they had a good track record of paying other vendors (you know because you’ve checked their vendor references) but now something has happened and they’ve gone from a source of reliable orders and payments to a customer that can’t meet their obligations. Sometimes events occur that businesses may or may not have control of (remember the financial crisis?) and it negatively impacts their ability to pay.</p>
<h3><strong>What about the customers that are now past due but aren’t worthy of sending to a collection agency?</strong></h3>
<p>There are a number of ways for you turn a negative into a positive and then turn this positive back into positive cashflow.  Using a variety of these techniques can get you on the right road to payment.</p>
<h3><strong>Communication and Customer Experience Impacts Payment Frequency </strong></h3>
<p>Communicate with your clients about their customer experience on a frequent basis. Knowing your customers and their likes and concerns will help you service them better. They, in turn, may move you up on the “pay list” with the companies that get paid no matter what, even when cash is tight. This is the kind of insurance people and companies get with the “golden rule.” Treat others the way you’d like to be treated. For all of the tools, tips and techniques around collecting what’s owed to you, bringing a genuine empathy to the customer relationship pays off in intangible ways with positive feelings and tangible ways like always getting paid (and impacting positive cashflow).</p>
<h3><strong>Look for Solutions to Help Your Late Payers Get Their Bills Paid</strong></h3>
<p>“I love being a deadbeat, not paying any of my bills on time and getting collections calls” said no one ever.  When your clients are late paying and you have to consistently call them for payment, know that they are suffering.  Positioning the payment issue as a problem that you might be able to help them with may change their attitude about working to get your bill paid off. Working together to solve a problem takes away the judgment and the moral dilemma of your slowest paying customer. Sometimes people make no payments if they think you’ll need the entire payment right away. If they need to cut the payment in two and you’ve got the ability to do this with them, you can make suggestions like paying 50% now and 50% in a week when they get paid from their customers.  Showing kindness and consideration for those customers who are having a cash flow crunch can buy you a lot of good will.  As a business owner, you know that these cash flow crunches happen.  It’s not if, it’s when.  Offering some compassion and understanding will get you far ahead in the collections game. Remember, you do get more bees with honey than with vinegar.</p>
<p>What about the late payers who are late payers by “choice?” Some of your customers will believe that it is there right to pay you late. That the terms posted clearly on the invoice are not about them. Sticky situation, right? You want to keep a positive attitude towards your customers but when they don’t pay you in a timely manner, you might begin to resent them.  They might start avoiding you. You can have a conversation with them about what’s going on in their business and assess if they’re sharing honestly with you about the circumstances. Ask them if there is something missing that you could do to make them a happier customer? What’s in the way of them expediting payment on the oldest outstanding invoice? Did they know you accept credit cards? Is this a better method to be using instead of the net 30 credit offering you’ve been giving them? Suggesting a solution and having the late paying customer choose another method of payment can empower them and get you paid faster.</p>
<p>Whether it is a good customer having a hard time paying their bills or a customer that might be taking advantage of your good nature and your payment terms either situation engenders actions around collections that mix “money and honey.” The big idea here is that you can relieve pressure on the customer about their outstanding debt and working with them to support a solution that has your agreement be back in integrity. It feels better when we’re not in a situation where there’s pressure and concern and for that, it makes the transaction sweeter.</p>
<p>We’re mixing money and honey and it’s a win-win when we can do that for our customer. After all, we don’t know when the shoe might be on the other foot and we’ll need some help in making payments if for some reason the economy goes sideways and it impacts us. There’s a saying in small business “everyone gets a turn” and that’s about being on a rollercoaster going up and going down—no one is immune to the business cycle. It’s better to help someone now and in turn, you’d hope someone will help you in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Making a Successful Collections Call</strong></h3>
<p>Before you get on a call familiarize yourself with the customer’s account.  Know how long they’ve been a customer, understand their payment history (is this the first time they haven’t made a payment or is this an ongoing situation?), look to see if you have a personal relationship with the customer or if they’re “new to you”, find out the total owed and if it’s one or many open invoices. Determine before you make the collections call how much your want (hopefully, the full amount) and what you’d accept (maybe 50% of the outstanding balance). Now that you know the situation, you’re ready to make the call. First, thank them for their business. Tell them that you’ve appreciated their loyalty and thank them for their good payment history in the past.  Ask the person if there’s something specific that is impacting their ability to pay. Tell them that you need to be paid and tell them the total amount. If they say they can’t pay the total amount, ask them what they can pay. Never get off the phone with a late paying customer without getting some kind of commitment to pay. Collect the money on a credit card, get the money wired or have someone pick up a check if its local business and the amount makes a difference on your cashflow. Thank the person for working with you on solving the problem together. Tell them how much you appreciate them.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Prevent a Small Delay on a Very Big Invoice</strong></h3>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you never had to do a collection call? One of the best techniques I know to use for the kinds of invoices that impact your business’ cashflow and your ability to pay your vendors is to preemptively call the accounts payable department of your big customer and ask them if you can expect their payment on time. Sometimes these customers might have a tendency to be a few days to a few weeks late. If this is the case, creating a relationship with the accounts payable department at your customer’s office could be one of the most valuable relationships that you cultivate at that company.</p>
<p>“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” as the saying goes. Don’t be embarrassed to ask these questions, “can I expect payment for invoice number 123 on the day it is due? Have you put our invoice in your payment queue? Is there anything in the way of having us be paid on time? Is all the documentation that you need in order to pay me provided and complete? Make sure the accounts payable department person (often, it’s a small group of people paying vendors) knows your situation. It might give you “most favored nation” status whereas you get paid first instead of with the rest of the pack or worse.</p>
<h3><strong>Achieving “Financial Boredom” Through Seamless Payments and Positive Cashflow</strong></h3>
<p>As a wise business person once said “we train people how to treat us.” Creating a seamless payment and positive cashflow environment is all about rules, protocols and relationships.  Seamless payments like scheduled credit card payments or collecting your payment when services are rendered or working on a retainer method can take away the headaches of collections, reduces your average DSO for your company and keeps the relationships that you have with your customers clean. Making certain that you get paid for the work that you’ve done not only makes you feel good as a person but it also keeps the financial foundations of your company solid which means you’ll be able to forecast cashflows and the predictability of payments from your customers.  In doing so, you’ll show a regularity of results that becomes ingrained in the financial underpinnings of your business. Yes, it might create a boring scenario but that’s the kind of boredom any business owner would like—I expect that you would too.</p>
<h3><strong>It’s Math and Honey</strong></h3>
<p>Running your small business takes a few key performance indicators like DSO to regulate the results that best support your success. It’s simple math that helps you understand your business results. The personal relationships that you foster helps drive those results. It’s the honey that makes running your business so sweet.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>“Metrics that Matter”</em> <em>is a four-part series designed to deliver a pathway and a practice to the most impassioned small business owners.  The ones that built their companies not because they had a background in business but a passion for delivering the kinds of products and services they clearly saw a need for delivered at a service level that was missing from the marketplace.  This series is designed to empower and elevate you and your team so that you can win the game. </em></p>
<p>Small business is filled with big stories.  Every owner has the “catching the biggest fish” story and the “business near death” story where victory was snatched out of the jaws of defeat at nearly the last minute. If you look behind the scenes of these stories you’ll see that every story ends with this point: “cash is king.”</p>
<p>Any one-on-one conversation between small business owners moves from talk of a variety of amazing achievements to the sticky situations that they have gotten themselves into while working on their amazing achievement. Underneath this storytelling is an axiom that cash is king.  Yes, in small business, the more cash you have, the less vulnerable you are and thus, the more powerful you feel.  You can be the smart person who can take advantage of the buyer’s market or purchasing bulk inventory at a particularly favorable price to offset your cost of goods sold for the next quarter if you are flush and have great cash management best practices.</p>
<p>Being flush is the best feeling in the world for a small business owner. Why? Because having enough cash in the bank to float the business “rain or shine” in “good times and bad” and all of these other cliched sayings is the way to have the freedom that we all sought when we started our small businesses.  When you have cash, you can feel good natured or generous even if your largest customer is late in paying their big bill, it gives you the confidence that you can continue operating in a manner that feels more comfortable than hustling and living on the possibility that tomorrow you’ll be able to sell more than you did today.  Being flush is the source of delicious and deep sleep something that might have evaded entrepreneurs since starting their businesses.</p>
<p>Having a clear set of best practices around how you manage your cash will help you create stable margins in your business which breeds predictability, a cushion of cash and the freedom to grow your business.  When you manage your accounts properly, you will be able to predict your inflows and outflows which is key to business performance. Your cash management capabilities impact every aspect of your business.  Let’s take a look at cash management best practices that will help you gain control, confidence and margin stability in your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Practice #1: A weekly cashflow journal while you’re learning the ropes</strong></h3>
<p>Starting a business means learning how cashflows come into and go out of the business.  Using a weekly cash flow journal is the simplest way to learn about the burgeoning patterns of cashflows. You can easily do this journal with a pencil and a preprinted calendar, set up a notebook specifically for this task or use an excel spreadsheet that you make.</p>
<p>You are recording all the revenues you receive daily and from which customers for what items or services, if they are recurring or one-time payments. Then you record your daily expenditures—what bills have you paid, what they are for and if they are a one-time or recurring payment.  At the end of the day, add up your revenues and reduce the number by your expenses to get your daily cashflow numbers. If you have a business with lots of transactions like an ice cream shop or restaurant, you can batch these transactions by income stream—for example: make an income line item for in-store sales, wine or beverage sales, and a line item for wholesale revenues (i.e. for selling ice cream to restaurants) for example.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to arrive at the same outcome as the business owner with a marketing consulting company that might have relatively few daily transactions. You will start to understand how cash is moving in and out of your business. This commences the process where you can start intuiting the rhythms of your business—the ebbs and flows of your daily activities. From this place, you are able to tweak and tune how much you’d like to sell to hit your target metrics for sales and the net cash you’re able to take away at the end of the day.  Using a cashflow journal has you learn what kinds of sales results you are producing, what kinds of expenses you are racking up, what days are the most busy for sales and the frequency in which you’re paying out money.</p>
<p>This kind of activity has you, the business owner, start generating the numbers for your first metric called in short hand, “the acid test.” The acid test has you understand the ratio between current assets and current liabilities. Your goal is a “high liquidity” business especially for those of you who are just starting out.  A high liquidity means that you’re able to pull cash to cover unexpected expenses, or buy materials if you find a great deal.  The rule of thumb for good cash management is your income should be at least twice that of your liabilities. That is the metric that will make you feel confident that you’ll be able to consistently pay your bills regardless of if you’ve received terms or not from your vendors.  The journey from newbie to becoming a crackerjack with cash is the first great journey an entrepreneur takes.  In becoming masterful, you are taking the cash journal from an intellectual exercise and making it an action that becomes second nature. This will have you become a pro at making cash king in your business in no time.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Practice #2: Treating Cash as Three Different Revenue Sources</strong></h3>
<p>Cash is cash is cash, right?  Well, let’s unpack this.  Thinking that there is more than one kind of cash will have you treating your cash flow differently. Treating your cash differently will change your relationship to the cash that comes in and how you’ll be able to use that money inside the business.   First, there is operating capital. This is the money that you need now to keep your business running.  This is the kind of cash you make payroll with and buy materials with—this cash is the basic and essential use for cash. Then there’s financing capital which you want to set aside for growing the business.  You need cash for things like a down payment for equipment or buying a building.  Then there is R&amp;D money—the money that you need to develop new products and services. Too often entrepreneurs try to fuel their R&amp;D efforts from the same pool of operating capital that keeps the business afloat.  This is a sure way of short changing your R&amp;D because as we all know, operations will need more or less money to keep operating dependent upon growth.</p>
<p>If you tag the cash that comes into your business for different purposes, you will segment that capital in a manner that helps you set aside money for the things you want—almost like a vacation saving account you can get at a bank.  Harry Lowenstein, my SCORE mentor in NYC, told me this ditty, “every dollar has a job.” So true, so true Harry! If I have money that I’m not certain what to do with, I’ll spend it somewhere on something that later on, I’ve mostly come to regret.  When every dollar has a job, every dollar is assigned to a line item or budget item, ensuring that you’re funding the things that you want rather than spending on things that you don’t want in the long run.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Practice #3: Create a Great Cashflow Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Most startup entrepreneurs have to learn the ropes to creating an environment that has customers pay fast and on time.  A rookie mistake that so many new business owners make is starting out offering terms when they need cash and sales the most. Most of these startups can’t afford to offer terms.  This leads automatically to a precarious cashflow situation and many sleepless nights.  So how do small business owners set up the rules of engagement? Small business owners must create the pathway for customers to know how to pay. Different conventions for different industries help illuminate a way that payments are made and accepted.</p>
<p>Let’s think about that restaurant example again—diners come in and order their meals and receive a check at the table when they’re finished with their dining experience—the waitperson gets a check ready, hands it off to the diner and is ready for payment. Most diners know this convention. The same restaurant might do big catering. A sizable deposit is expected for a large catering. A caterer asking for a deposit is part of the convention that this industry dictates and meets the expectation of the client. The caterer might take checks, credit cards, cash, PayPal, Square or Venmo to make payments easy for clients. These familiar patterns have customers feel comfortable for paying at least a portion of their payment upfront.  The right environment tells your clients how they are going to pay for your products or services—and this is key to your business model working and the conditions for your cashflows.</p>
<p>We’ve just talked about best practices so that you can get your cash game on like an old pro. Now listen and learn from these “Most Definitely Don’ts” so that you can avoid the common mistakes of junior level cashflow management.</p>
<h3><strong>Most Definitely Don’t #1:  The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions</strong></h3>
<p>Saint Bernard Clairvaux said “the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.” Hell for small business owners means cash is tight and uncertainty around customer payments. Small business owners get into the habit of “robbing Peter to pay Paul” because they are focused on servicing the customer and look at payment terms as a means to offering service to customers. Entrepreneurs sometimes confuse what they see as good manners with good business.  Of course, we want to be solicitous to our clients (especially the ones we really like) but most small business owners don’t understand what the cost of servicing the customer is by offering terms indiscriminately.</p>
<p>So what happens when one of those customers doesn’t pay on time or doesn’t pay at all? The small business takes on uncollectible debt or has no recourse to collect these debts other than the courts (time consuming) or through a collections agency (pennies on the dollar) so instead of feeling the discomfort of asking for payment at the beginning of the transaction, the small business owner waits to collect money towards the end of the transaction which increases risk of non-payment, financing fees, and other hidden costs that business owners take on when giving customers terms.</p>
<h3><strong>Most Definitely Don’t #2: Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</strong></h3>
<p>Small business owners don’t like anyone to tell them what to do, right? One the reasons you decided to be your own boss is because you eschew the idea of someone else telling you what to do. So I’m going to tell you a cardinal rule of what not to do… rob Peter to pay Paul.  If you are a general contractor, small real estate investor (landlords and property management) or other professions that have progress payments or long contract and payment cycles, there’s always the inclination to rob Peter to pay Paul—that is use money from one job to cover expenses from another. Here’s why you don’t want to do this first and foremost &#8212; if you rob Peter to pay Paul chances are you won’t be able to catch up in the profit arena.  You simply will ebb away your profit margins by doing this.</p>
<p>Think of the costs for each job as a swim lane in an Olympic sized pool. If each customer is represented by a swimmer, wouldn’t it be weird to see one swimmer hop over the lane divider and start swimming in someone else’s lane? Sure, it would!  You will want to isolate costs to individual jobs especially if a job might get behind in its delivery schedule or encounters other issues.  You will want to cordon off any potential issues of that one job from impacting the others. Keeping accounts clear and staying on top of payments, receivables and collections will help keep your customers in line and your margins straight, and your cash flowing.</p>
<h3><strong>“Cash is King” because Cash is Freedom</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s face it: as a small business owner you want two things: freedom of choice and control. You wouldn’t run a business if you didn’t at core want these two things. Cash management practices are at the heart of your business’ well-being which directly connects to your personal well-being and financial wholeness.  Too often business owner’s optimism and good will towards their customers and clients has them make decisions that negatively impact their financial position.  You might think that you didn’t go into business because of your “financial position” but because you want to fulfill a mission. If you don’t have best practices around cash management you will find that your well-being, overall happiness and business success will be negatively impacted by the very thing that you thought would make you happy.</p>
<p>At the heart of your deepest desires to build that successful small business you had always dreamed about is your ability to take your business idea and bring it to fruition. The key skill for small business owners no matter what industry or business model is proper cash management.  At the intersection of  where your business mission meets your personal commitments, your social purpose and the accomplishments you are driven to deliver lies your level of mastery and ability to create the circumstances that allows your business to thrive.  At the center of this abundance is your masterful cash management. Think about it, what can you and your business do without the rocket fuel that brings you closer to your dreams?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong> Five Steps to Supercharged Results for the Change Agent Entrepreneur</strong></h3>
<p>You became an entrepreneur because you knew that you could do your thing better than anyone else out there. You knew that you could make something great because you believe in yourself and have that special magic to bring your idea into reality. With the approaching new year, it’s time to assess and review what is bringing us closer to our ideas and ideals and to do away with what isn’t. Achievement comes naturally to the parts of the business that play to our strengths while we struggle with the rest.   Its time to make that “left turn at Albuquerque” like Bugs Bunny said and change direction on what’s not working.  Blowing the lid off obstacles will open up a whole new aspect of achievement, excitement and newness that could just be the kind of gamechanger that you’re looking for in the new year.</p>
<h3><strong>Entrepreneurs are Masterful Change Agents</strong></h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs are masterful agents of change—the premise of entrepreneurship isn’t about doing things the same, it’s inherently about making change.  Supercharging your results means that you’ve got to change from your current state to get to the next. This means there are no sacred cows in the business and that you’re able to jettison what’s weighing down the business down instead of lifting it up. It’s the essence of change.</p>
<h3><strong>Possibility and Change</strong></h3>
<p>As entrepreneurs, possibility is our go-go juice.  We love the thought of achieving all the goals on our checklists because then, only then, will we be able to have next level results—more money, more exposure, more satisfaction, more time off. We can imagine an entire office of well-trained employees who can handle the workload while we’re enjoying winter vacations on a secluded tropical island. They won’t ever text or call because they’re so confident and capable of managing things and they simply don’t need us to run the day to day operations. Can’t you just see it?  All the things that we wish for when we see the clean slate presented by a new year coupled with the vision of the future where we’ve achieved our great outcomes makes an entrepreneur’s success meter rise up like a terrier’s prance when they have won “best in show.” The possibility of the future is enticing and draws us in every time, the feeling of success is palpable—but how do we get from where we are today to where we want to go?</p>
<h3><strong>The Color of Kool-Aid</strong></h3>
<p>An entrepreneur has to believe more than anyone else in the change that they are making in the world by creating their company, their products and by bringing their community to the mix.  We believe so much in what we’re creating that sometimes we don’t know that we might need to make a change along the way that makes the whole thing better.  Think of it this way, its not that you drank your own Kool-Aid and now you don’t believe in it, it’s that the Kool-Aid you drank was one color and now it might be time to introduce another color. Rarely, if at all, past a certain moment in time, a pure vision and the purist don’t stand in step with the outcomes required. Change requires introspection and a willingness to evolve.</p>
<h3><strong>Roadmapping for Road Tripping to Supercharged Results</strong></h3>
<p>After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Americans were enchanted by the idea of homesteading—leaving the East and to set out West to put a stake in the ground and claim their fortune of land and legacy.  Westward Expansion like entrepreneurship means believing more in the vision of what will come rather than what you have now.  Just like the settlers of the Western Expansion, entrepreneurs need a roadmap from the current state to the next level—consider this your roadmap to the next level.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-170620 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rocketforweb.jpg?resize=600%2C564&#038;ssl=1" alt="Have 2018 Be Your Best Year Ever | Lisa Hendrickson for OnDeck" width="600" height="564" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rocketforweb.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rocketforweb.jpg?resize=300%2C282&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step One: Assess Current State Results.</strong></h3>
<p>Getting clear about what you and your team have achieved in closing the year is a key yet often overlooked step for success. Knowing where you are in the growth journey of your company and the results that the current company efforts are putting on the scoreboard will give you a baseline for measuring the improvements for the upcoming year.  Assess financial results, operational efficiencies, customer service wins and losses, brand awareness, marketing effectiveness and any other aspects of the business that you seek to improve upon. If you are not able to measure, assess, evaluate and correct current state results because you haven’t made the systems to do so, make it a priority now to devise ways to evaluate your company’s performance in a consistent and timely manner.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Two: Define Success.</strong></h3>
<p>What is success? So often we assume that success is what everybody expects, not necessarily what we believe makes us successful as an entrepreneur and as a person.  Have you spent time quietly thinking and writing down what your personal definition of success is?  If you haven’t defined what success means to you, no matter what results you and your team achieve, you might not feel fulfilled. Why? Because success is personal and until you define this for yourself, you aren’t able to pinpoint exactly where you want your entrepreneurial venture to take you personally. As the leader of your team, if you’re uncertain of the definition of success, do you think your employees can align behind the idea? Max De Pree, ex-CEO of Herman Miller and author of many best-selling books on business leadership said, “the first responsibility of a leader is to define reality.” Agreed.  Defining creates a tangible state.  Tangibility will bring your idea of success from ephemeral to achievable.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Three: Turn Your Idea of Success into a Business Purpose.</strong></h3>
<p>Outside of making money, what is the purpose of your business? Jack Welsh famously said his mission at GE was to make the company number one or number two in the markets it participated in.  I’d challenge the notion that this was a mission—I believe it to be an objective.  They are different.  An objective is an intended outcome from a project or a plan. A mission or purpose is something that is open ended and has a multitude of ways that it can be enacted upon.  Here’s the Starbuck’s mission statement: To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one cup, one person, one neighborhood at a time.” Helping others ensures that you receive the same for yourself. Think of it like the rule of karma or reaping what you sow—helping others through a purposeful approach in business will create meaning and satisfaction for you, your employees, and the people that you serve. Now more than ever, expressing your purpose to a hyper-connected world brings your brand to life and has customers make an emotional connection with you and your company.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Four: Align Business Habits with Purpose, Goals and Desired Outcomes.</strong></h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs are visionaries.  We can see the future when we close our eyes. We turn vision into drive and drive causes actions.  Actions produce results.  It’s easy for entrepreneurs to connect the purpose to an idea and an idea to action steps but its harder for us to share this process with our employees.  Too often small business owners and entrepreneurs expect their staff to just “get it.” Reducing the disconnect between what you envision and what your employees produce can help minimize the risk of failed campaigns and poor business results. By creating company habits like a morning check in or weekly reporting of results, we’re able to take our ideas and see the actions and results in the day to day business efforts.  When putting in the right business habits we foster goal-oriented action.</p>
<p>Knowing the difference between a purpose, a goal and an outcome gives entrepreneurs the fortitude to break down the complexity that has us often abandon change agent projects because they get too cumbersome. When we feel the purpose and goals in our bones, then our natural drive towards the outcomes helps us change our personal behaviors.  When we make change personally, then we can institute change inside of the business.  Aligned actions produce supercharged results.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Five: Make Your Business Goals Personal to Your Employees.</strong></h3>
<p>In the book “Good to Great” Jim Collins writes about how high performing companies become that way. His keen observation about motivation has stuck with me many years after initially reading the book.  To paraphrase Collins said “You don’t need to motivate employees.  They already come to you motivated.  The idea is to not demotivate them.” So how do we do that as small business owners and entrepreneurs?  We create projects that ask employees to align their own goals with our business goals.  Let’s say you have an employee who has wanted to ride their bike across the state raising money for charity but have never done it.  What if you could bring together a business outcome with this personal outcome? What if you helped her achieve her goal while she helped the business achieve its goals? Do you think you’d create a sense of urgency and connectedness between the business goals and your employee’s personal one? Once the goals are achieved, don’t you think you’d have an employee who felt real ownership of the brand, her work and a sense of reciprocity that will help drive her to step outside of her comfort zone to produce change agent results?  (Hint: your answers to all of these questions is yes.).</p>
<h3><strong>Map Legend.</strong></h3>
<p>A few clarifying points to help you navigate your way to the next level. Think of this as a mix of personal and business tools that help declutter your journey as a change agent entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Connection Between Strategy and Execution is the Plan.</em></strong></p>
<p>The only difference between a vision and a pipedream is action.  Connecting vision and execution are key to having your entrepreneurial vision be realized. Helping your employees move from vision to execution is the project plan.  This is an important part of your change map and its often overlooked. If you aren’t using a project plan or project documentation in your small business, you are missing an opportunity to offset work with tools that can help you see potential trouble around the corner. Usually the block for small business owners is learning a new software and implementing that tool inside the business.  Know that planning for the amount of time it will take to introduce and implement a new tool will be about twice as long as the salesperson testifies to and that until proficient at using the tool, your team will grumble about it and be slower at achieving the task.  Knowing this ahead of time helps you plan for the implementation. Be bold and strike out with new efficiencies.  They absolutely will help you to free up time, reduce errors and see problems before they become big ones.</p>
<p><strong><em>Give Up “The Next Shiny Penny” Syndrome</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Chasing after the next shiny penny is just that, chasing after something that after awhile just isn’t that interesting or valuable to you and your organization, worse it’s a distraction that never seems to fully pay off.  It’s a vicious cycle where we entrepreneurs see opportunities everywhere and we wind up chasing the shiny penny because we think it’s the Treasure of the Sierra Madre and this time, this time, it’s the one….we confuse the possibility of the business with the shortcut of the next shiny penny.  Giving up the distraction of the next shiny penny brings sanity to the larger idea that we’re striving to achieve.</p>
<p>Following the Five Steps of A Change Agent Entrepreneur roadmap will get you on the pathway to making changes in your business and your business results but just like driving on the thruway, there’s always rules of the road.</p>
<h3><strong>Rules of the Road. </strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>Make no more than three big goals per quarter.</em></span>  If you’re a small business where resources are scheduled tight and there’s not a lot of wiggle room in the calendar, you should be hyper-focused on achieving three key goals at most per quarter. Your organization most likely isn’t equipped to achieve more than that given the constraints.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>Have a quarterly goal visual display on every project plan or project document</em>.</span>  Goals will seem ephemeral or just forgotten if they’re spoken about at a meeting and then not integrated into the day to day work that the business does.  Find ways to have team members relate to the goal as something that is top of mind, not something that’s remembered towards the end of the quarter or around bonus time.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>You cannot improve that which you do not measure. </em></span>Having a means to determine what your game is, what is a measure for success helps you and your team understand what is working or what programs or campaigns need improvement. Measuring and assessing in real time allows you and your team to make pivots and adjustments so that results aren’t examined and learned from after the fact.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>There is no such thing as common sense. </em></span>If it was so common, then everyone would have it, no? Do not expect people to understand what you want.  You have to show people what you want and then develop that sensibility within your employees. Those are the elements of brand by the way. That special sauce that only your company knows how to make.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>What you believe you achieve.</em></span>  If you believe it with passion and know it in your bones that what you’re out to accomplish is achievable, the people will come along.  Whether its your employees or the public, if you’ve got the confidence and fire in the belly to make it happen, the world will accommodate you and your personal definition of success.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>Hope is not a strategy</em>.</span>  Hoping that things will get done or get better without taking an action is like thinking that you’ll be able to run a marathon by watching one on TV. It just takes more than what you’re doing now to make changes.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
<p>“A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step” (Lao Tzu) and that wisdom applies to any kind of actions made by you, the Change Agent Entrepreneur.  Schedule step one on the roadmap in your calendar and keep that appointment with yourself. You will see how the steps unfold for you.  Yes, it might feel uncomfortable at first, but making these changes in your business will help you focus on achievement of next level results.</p>
<p>All pioneers and Change Agent Entrepreneurs step out into the unknown and learn a new territory, find ways to overcome obstacles and prevail in a new landscape.  Defining your own path and taking it on with whole-heartedness, smarts and a plan in hand will have you ahead of the pack and achieving inspired and supercharged results.  Onward into the future!</p>
