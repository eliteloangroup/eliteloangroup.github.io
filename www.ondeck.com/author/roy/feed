								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the year, while consumers are pursuing New Year’s resolutions, business owners and entrepreneurs are busy making plans as well. Typical goals include improving marketing outreach, making more sales, increasing efficiency, adopting technology, cutting expenses, and generating more revenue. Another popular goal is organizing your business. This can include everything from organizing your physical workspace to organizing your digital files to organizing your financial plans.</p>
<p>While many business owners may have a general sense of how they’d like to organize their business, having a vague goal to get more organized is one thing, having a detailed strategy for achieving organization is another. Here are four steps you can take to get your business organized in the new year.</p>
<h3>Using the Big Picture to Define Your Strategy</h3>
<p>When planning how to organize your business, keeping the big picture in mind will help keep you strategically focused and keep you from wasting time majoring in minors. Key strategic business questions fall into <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-leaders-can-focus-on-the-big-picture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five major categories</a>, says London Business School professor Elsbeth Johnson.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission: What is the purpose of your organization?</li>
<li>Value: What do you offer customers?</li>
<li>Profitability: What does your company offer your business and shareholders?</li>
<li>Policy: How your company behaves internally towards other team members and externally toward customers and shareholders</li>
</ul>
<p>When organizing your business, you can use these general strategic areas as a template for generating more specific strategies and tactical plans. For example, while considering profitability, you may want to tackle questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could better organization of our marketing campaigns generate more leads?</li>
<li>How could better organization of our sales process generate more revenue?</li>
<li>How could better organization of our workflow, digital files, and physical workspace improve productivity and cut costs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these types of questions to guide your organizational planning can help ensure that your organizing activity makes a practical difference for your business, your productivity, and your bottom line.</p>
<h3>Taking a Team Approach</h3>
<p>Your strategic planning will be more informed if you get input from all relevant departments of your company instead of doing all the brainstorming yourself. Input from leaders of areas such as marketing, sales, customer service, project management, and IT can have a particularly critical impact on your business performance.</p>
<p>In order to solicit input in an organized manner, management professional Jonathan Mosley recommends taking <a href="https://www.smestrategy.net/blog/4-keys-to-successful-strategic-planning-with-your-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four steps</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize the importance of your meetings to participants so that they understand its impact on your company’s performance.</li>
<li>Have a written agenda for each meeting, circulate it prior to the meeting, and stick to it.</li>
<li>Have a designated chair run each meeting, a designated scribe record notes, and a designated timekeeper to advise the chair when agenda items are running over budgeted time.</li>
<li>Plan on scheduling more than one meeting in order to keep agendas and discussions focused.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following this format will help you solicit input from your team members in an organized, productive, actionable way.</p>
<h3>Setting Priorities</h3>
<p>When deciding what parts of your business to organize, it’s critical to use your strategic vision to set priorities, so that you focus on activities that will improve your business performance. For instance, leading marketing expert Jay Abraham says that there are <a href="https://www.abraham.com/cram3ways" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three major ways</a> to grow any business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the number of prospects you reach who become customers</li>
<li>Increase the average amount your customers spend per transaction</li>
<li>Increase the average number of times your customers buy from you</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizational improvements that impact these three key marketing and sales areas will have a direct impact on your business performance. For instance, better organization of your SEO and social media campaigns can increase the size of your customer base. You can also prioritize areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boosting customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Improving operational efficiency</li>
<li>Cutting costs</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, the necessary reorganization to achieve your priorities will be digital, while in other cases, it may be physical. For example, organizing your digital CRM files can be a step towards improving your sales. Similarly, organizing your workers’ work stations can help improve efficiency.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Tasks and Tracking Progress</h3>
<p>What doesn’t get scheduled, doesn’t get done. In order to implement your organizational plans, it’s vital to organize your team’s schedule so that you budget in time for performing relevant tasks. The most efficient way to do this is to use project management software to create, delegate, and schedule tasks and to track progress. Assign one person as project leader to monitor progress on organizational tasks and send out reminders as needed. Send out periodic updates on project progress, and hold periodic meetings to review progress.</p>
<p>Basing your organizational plan on major strategic goals such as marketing, sales, and project management goals can help you keep your organizing focused on practical objectives. Getting input from your whole team can give you more insight into what organizational goals to pursue and how to go about pursuing them. Setting priorities helps you focus your time and energy on organizational improvements that will truly make a practical impact on your business. Scheduling tasks and measuring progress will help ensure that your organizational plans get implemented. Following these steps will help you succeed at getting your business organized so that you can be more efficient and more profitable in the coming year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While you don&#8217;t need a business plan to run a business. Following a good business plan can mean the difference between achieving success and going out of business. Completing a written business plan actually <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/business-plan-success-twice-as-likely.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubles the chances of your business succeeding</a>. The survey results showed that business owners who complete written business plans are twice as likely to grow their business, secure investment capital or secure a business loan. Having a plan makes your business more attractive to investors and lenders because it shows that you’ve thought through your marketing, operational and financing strategy and you’ve actually crunched the numbers to show you’re a good credit risk. Here’s a guide to the components that go into <a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/district/mo/st-louis/resources/how-write-business-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a winning business plan</a> so you can make your business a success.</p>
<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The first part of a business plan is an executive summary, which provides a brief snapshot of your entire business plan. Your executive summary should cover the highlights of the other sections of your business plan, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your business description</li>
<li>Your design and development plan</li>
<li>Your operational and management plan</li>
<li>Your competitive analysis</li>
<li>Your marketing and sales strategy</li>
<li>Your financial projections</li>
<li>Your funding needs</li>
</ul>
<p>An executive summary should briefly cover each of these topics, devoting one or a few sentences to each topic over the course of a page or two. Subsequent sections of your business plan will expand on each of these topics in more detail. While an executive summary is the first part of your business plan, you may find it easier to write it after you have written your other sections, or you can write an initial outline of your executive summary and then flesh it out after you complete your business plan’s individual sections.</p>
<h3>Business Description</h3>
<p>Your business description should sum up who you are, what you do, how you do it, who you do it for, and why customers will pay you to do it. It should include answers to questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company name?</li>
<li>What is your business mission?</li>
<li>What problem does your company solve?</li>
<li>How does your product or service solve this problem?</li>
<li>Who needs a solution to your problem?</li>
<li>What makes your company’s solution stand out from that offered by competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will help you clarify your company’s identity and position you in the eyes of potential investors and lenders reading your business plan. It will also provide some background for the rest of your business plan.</p>
<h3>Design and Development Plan</h3>
<p>Your design and development section should describe your product or service. It should answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you sell?</li>
<li>What are the key features of your product or service?</li>
<li>What is your product lifecycle?</li>
<li>What are the key benefits?</li>
<li>What complementary products and services do you sell as upsells or cross-sells?</li>
<li>Do your products and services require any research and development?</li>
<li>Do you need any intellectual property protection such as patents or copyrights?</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will help you clarify the key sales appeal of your product and service line, as well as identify any development that needs to be done to bring your product or service to market.</p>
<h3>Operations and Management Plan</h3>
<p>The operations and management section of your plan lays out how your company is organized. It should address:</p>
<ul>
<li>What legal structure does your company use?</li>
<li>Who are your company’s key personnel, and what expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Will you need to hire any additional personnel with specialized skills, such as sales, design or software development?</li>
<li>What is the general workflow of your daily flow of operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will clarify how you plan to set up and run your company. It will also identify any hiring or outsourcing needs you have, which will be important for estimating your expenses when you do your financial projections.</p>
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>Your competitive analysis section sums up your market research. It should identify who is in your target market and how large your market is. It should also identify your main competitors and how you plan to compete with them to attract your target buyers. This section should answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people buy products and services such as yours?</li>
<li>How much do they spend?</li>
<li>Why do they buy?</li>
<li>Who are your main competitors?</li>
<li>What does the market want that your competitors aren’t delivering?</li>
<li>What will you offer that is different than your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your competitive analysis will provide a basis for developing your marketing strategy. It will also help you estimate your potential revenue, which will be important for writing the financial section of your business plan.</p>
<h3>Marketing and Sales Strategy</h3>
<p>The marketing strategy section of your plan builds on your market research by identifying the specific strategies and tactics you will use to reach your target market and persuade them to buy from you. It should cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing channels will you use to reach prospective customers?</li>
<li>What marketing themes will you use to attract prospects?</li>
<li>What sales process will you use to turn prospects into buying customers?</li>
<li>How will you turn customers into repeat buyers?</li>
<li>What will be the average value of a sale?</li>
<li>What will be the average lifetime value of a customer?</li>
<li>How much revenue will you generate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will help you think through your marketing and sales strategy and will demonstrate to investors and lenders that you have a viable plan to generate revenue.</p>
<h3>Financial Projections</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/business-plan-financial-section_pagen_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial projections section</a> of your plan should estimate your company’s key financials for the next three to five years. It should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income statements</li>
<li>Balance sheets</li>
<li>Cash flow statements</li>
<li>Break-even analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Your statements for your first year should be broken down by quarter or by month. This will give you a clearer idea of how much money you’ll have coming in, how much expenses you’ll need to cover, and how much additional capital you need to fund your business plan. This will also provide the numbers you need to convince investors and lenders of your business model’s viability and your funding needs.</p>
<h3>Funding Needs</h3>
<p>Your funding needs section lays out your request for any financing you need to close the gap between your current capital and your projected expenses. It should state:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much you need</li>
<li>What you need it for</li>
<li>What length of time you need it for</li>
<li>How you plan to pay it back or otherwise compensate investors</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is designed both to help you estimate your needs and to help you persuade investors and lenders to support you. To make this section more persuasive, you may choose to supplement it with visual aids or a video dramatizing your vision of your company and your funding request.</p>
<p>Your business plan outlines your company’s roadmap to success. Your plan’s executive summary provides a brief overview of your plan. The remaining sections of your plan detail who your company is, what you sell, how your business is organized, how you plan to compete, your marketing and sales strategy, your financial projections and your funding needs. Taking the time to write your business plan will improve your ability to attract funding and increase your company’s odds of financial success.</p>
<p>The best business plans are living, breathing documents that grow and along with your business. They are not a document you write and never look at again. Keep it handy so you can easily measure your success or change course before its too late.</p>
