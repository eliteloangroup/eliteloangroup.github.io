								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentine’s Day might be the single busiest day of the year for your business. Whether you’re a florist, chocolatier, or jewelry maker, Valentine&#8217;s Day is an excellent opportunity to boost sales and bring new customers to your store. In fact, Valentine’s Day sales reached an all-time high of $19.7 billion in 2016 – according to Entrepreneur.</p>
<p>How can small business owners capitalize on the holiday? OnDeck customer and small business owner, Gerald Palumbo, does the following things to prepare his florist shop for the holiday:</p>
<ol>
<li>I take a look at what I ordered last year. If I ran out of something last year, I make sure to buy it in bulk this year.</li>
<li>We hire additional staff to help during the holiday.</li>
<li>We pay attention to what day of the week the holiday falls on. A weekday is great for us because we’re in the city and people come here after work.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more Valentine&#8217;s Day tips, read the full interview below. You can also hear from more OnDeck customers on how they&#8217;ve grown their business <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/success-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Rosen: </strong>Hi, I&#8217;m Paul Rosen, Chief Sales Officer for OnDeck. I&#8217;m here with one of our great customers, Gerald Palumbo from Seasons, A Floral Design Studio. Gerald, thanks so much for hosting us today.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald Palumbo:</strong> My pleasure!</p>
<p><strong>Paul: </strong>Now how did you get started in the business?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald: </strong>Well, I have had this store for about 27 and a half years. I started working here many years ago, 28/29 years ago, just as a part-time employee on Saturdays and, as it turned out, the owners sold the business and I managed to step in and take over the business back in 1989, so I&#8217;ve had this store ever since then.</p>
<p><strong>Paul: </strong>Nice! Now, Valentine&#8217;s Day is coming around the corner (effective my math is correct!). That&#8217;s not two weeks away!</p>
<div id="attachment_154061" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154061" class="size-full wp-image-154061" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/buildings.jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seasons, A Floral Design Studio New York, NY PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/buildings.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/buildings.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/buildings.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-154061" class="wp-caption-text">Seasons, A Floral Design Studio<br />New York, NY<br />PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg</p></div>
<p><strong>Gerald: </strong>Right!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> How does this holiday differ from other holidays that you have?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald: </strong>Well, Valentine&#8217;s Day is our single busiest day of the year. People that don&#8217;t typically buy flowers on a regular basis come up, show up for Valentine&#8217;s Day, so it’s our once-a-year customer sometimes but, with that said, we&#8217;re prepared. We hire additional staff, we sort of take a look at where we were in the past as far as what we ordered in the way of flowers, we increase our numbers or decrease our numbers depending on how the holiday falls during the week. This year it&#8217;s going to be an incredible Valentine&#8217;s Day because it falls on a Tuesday, which is ideal for us. We have a lot&#8211;our location here in midtown Manhattan&#8211;we are near offices, we’re near residences, so we’ll really capitalize on the fact that it’s on a Tuesday. So that&#8217;s our best possible scenario.</p>
<div id="attachment_154041" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154041" class="size-full wp-image-154041" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/flower_2.jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seasons, A Floral Design Studio New York, NY PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/flower_2.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/flower_2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/flower_2.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-154041" class="wp-caption-text">Seasons, A Floral Design Studio<br />New York, NY<br />PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg</p></div>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Cool. Now, while I&#8217;m here I need to get something for my wife, Sherry. For Valentine&#8217;s Day, do you have any special promotions or special deals?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Well, one of the things we are really well known for our arrangements. Yes, roses are a traditional sort of thing that people go for, but our customers are regular customers. They come to us because our arrangements are so special and we have a very lush European style that we do and so what I suggest to a lot of our clients is that we bring in the reds, the pinks, the whites. It has a feel of Valentine&#8217;s Day without being a dozen roses in a vase, which is pretty&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> That&#8217;s what I want!</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Okay, well we can help you with that! Let me, let me get started. I&#8217;ll pull some things together and we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>Paul: </strong>Now, do you mind if we continue to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> I don&#8217;t mind at all!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Alright, so you mentioned you had this business for 28 years &#8211; what changes or trends have you seen you know over the last several years and how have you adapted to them?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Well, flowers, like many things, it&#8217;s kind of like a fashion &#8211; certain things come in style, there are certain things that go out of style. Over the years, we&#8217;ve watched the style go from in the nineteen eighties that was kind of a modern tropical contemporary style, to the late eighties and nineties it became more of an English and European style. Now we&#8217;re seeing it trend a little bit back towards that contemporary style and you&#8217;re seeing people that want to see one type of flower and above, you&#8217;re seeing it get a little bit simpler. The people are all also looking for a little more of the unusual, so that&#8217;s where we try to step in. We always want to have a very large selection for people to choose from. We import flowers from all over the world, we get a majority of our flowers coming from Holland but we get flowers from France, we get flowers from Italy, we get flowers from South and Central America, we occasionally get flowers from Japan, and we want to&#8211;we do get a lot of things from the United States as well, but we also want to have this incredible variety that sets us apart from other flower shops that maybe have just the standard flowers that are pretty common.</p>
<p><strong>Paul: </strong>That makes sense and, for those of you that are just tuning in now, I&#8217;m Paul Rosen, Chief Sales Officer for OnDeck. We’re here working with one of our great customers, Gerald Palumbo, from Seasons, A Floral Design Studio and I believe you have two locations. You have this one in New York City, Manhattan, and then one in Irvington, New York.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Yes.</p>
<div id="attachment_154081" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154081" class="size-full wp-image-154081" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/outside.jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seasons, A Floral Design Studio New York, NY PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/outside.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/outside.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/outside.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-154081" class="wp-caption-text">Seasons, A Floral Design Studio<br />New York, NY<br />PHOTO CREDIT: Kate Glicksberg</p></div>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Talk to me a little bit more about how these locations are different.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Well, our store here in the city is relatively small but we do a lot of, a lot of business out of this store. In addition to being a retail store, we also do special events and galas and things like that. We are in in the Theater District right here in the Broadway area, so we&#8217;re involved with a lot of the theater producers. We do Broadway show openings; for example, we have a roundabout theater gala coming up at the end of this month. That&#8217;s going to be 600 people at the Waldorf-Astoria, so we&#8217;re doing all the décor, all the linens for that. In addition to doing weddings for people, we also do television and film work. We work with&#8211;for years we did the flowers for “The Good Wife” television show. There&#8217;s going&#8211;their new series is coming out this month in just a few days called “The Good Fight,” which is the spin-off. We&#8217;re doing all the flowers for all those episodes with “The Good Fight,” so that’s something else that we do as well. My background as an interior designer has helped me sort of work with set designers, decorators, event planners to get a better sense of floral design that works with its environment.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Cool. Now, how did you find OnDeck or how did we find you?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Well, it was just kind—it was just by chance. I was&#8211;I got a card in the mail. I got a letter from OnDeck in the mail and I read the letter and I said, this can&#8217;t possibly be this easy! This letter makes this sound like applying for this loan is really easy and&#8211;I said, well we have some things going on, we were looking at that point our first loan with OnDeck. We were just looking to consolidate, we were looking to do some capital improvements in the store, we were looking to improve, and some advertising and I said, well let me give these people a call and, lo and behold, within two days the money was in our account. I was pretty impressed, and then our second loan we took out with OnDeck is when the opportunity came to take over a store in Westchester and moving to New York and that is our location called Seasons on the Hudson. The woman that had owned the store for many years was looking to retire and she&#8217;s a friend of mine, she asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in purchasing her business, so I again called OnDeck and I said, well what can we do? And again they very quickly pulled the money together with a deal that had to happen quickly. At that point, I also talked to my own bank, which it just seemed like it was going to be weeks and weeks, and the process was a little unclear. They didn&#8217;t&#8212;they couldn’t even give me an answer whether or not it was gonna happen. And, excuse me, you have a customer walking through. You can go head on through to the back&#8211;but so we were a little put off by the bank, and so I went to OnDeck and I said, “we want to do this” and they said, “Great! Let&#8217;s look at it, you&#8217;re a good customer, you have a good reputation with us,” and, again, it was just a couple of days and the funds were in our account. We were able to make this transaction happen very quickly and that was the key &#8211; this deal with not going to stick around for a long time. It was either buy this business or they were going to sell it to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well, we are greatly appreciative to have you as a repeat customer. A lot of our customers find us through direct mail, through some of our distribution partners, referral partners, and brokers and a lot of customers find us on our website www.ondeck.com but again we really appreciate you as a customer. Now, what do you like best or love most about being a small business?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Well, I really enjoy working with the public. I like the retail end of it, I like working with customers. Being in New York, we have such a diverse clientele, we have people from all over the world so I think that&#8217;s really fascinating. People have very diverse tastes and we get the chance to meet a more sophisticated client, which I think is a lot of fun, but I also enjoy the display. I have a person that likes to do the visual display, so our visual displays, our window displays, here at Seasons in the city, are always beautiful and they always get bright comments. And in our store in Irvington, Seasons on the Hudson, also has beautiful window displays, which people like to take note of, really draws people in.</p>

<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well, now, last question. Many, many years ago I was a small business owner and I used to have friends and people come up to me all the time and say, “Oh, being an entrepreneur must be great! You can work whatever hours you want to make your own schedule,” and I’d be like, yeah you know I could work any 90 hours a week I decided to work. Do you feel the same way?</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> I do. You know you never, you never really walk away from it. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s your business. In the bottom line, when you&#8217;re an owner of a business, the box stops with me. So, if there&#8217;s a customer that is unhappy about something and my staff can&#8217;t seem to appease them, then it comes to me and I have to sort of solve that problem. If something happens, the window breaks, I’m the person that has to deal with calling the Glazers to get the window replaced. I have to deal with the insurance company when my employees are sick or something, I&#8217;ve got to make sure that I&#8217;ve got the coverage. So, I handle the ordering, I handle the problem with the ordering, if their flights delayed, our flowers didn&#8217;t arrive, we had a big party, I need to find another source to buy those clouds to make that party happen. You know, I&#8217;m pretty good at the problem-solving part of it—</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> It’s a lot!</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong>&#8211;but as the business owner that&#8217;s where it always lands on you, finding you’re working all the time, even when you’re on vacation!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Good, well, Gerald thanks so much for hosting us here at OnDeck and on Facebook Live, this looks awesome<br />
Gerald: thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Really excited and really appreciate your continued patronage as a customer.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald:</strong> Oh, my pleasure, my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Thank you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obtaining a small-business loan or establishing a credit line is not always easy these days. In the podcast series &#8211; &#8220;Been There, Done That, with Dennis Zink&#8221; &#8211; Dennis interviewed Ty Kiisel, Small Business Educator, at OnDeck. This interview discusses some challenges that an owner might confront when trying to use debt financing as an option to grow their business.</p>
<p>You can listen to the full <a href="http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/1/a/d/1ad357168d934179/Episode_43_-_Small_Business_Loans.mp3?c_id=13216012&amp;destination_id=166546&amp;expiration=1481152430&amp;hwt=4b4fb48e088a9ad67d9411e98b800f44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recording here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Zink</strong>: Ty, what is the greatest misconception that most small business owners have regarding business credit?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel: </strong>The greatest misconception owners have about business credit is that it actually exists. They are surprised to learn that their business has a business credit profile.</p>
<p><strong>Zink:</strong> What do lenders want to see in terms of credit scores?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> A traditional bank, for example, wants to see a credit score of 700-ish. However, in some instances, they may drop to 680. If your credit score is below 680, you probably won&#8217;t find success at a bank. The SBA (U.S. Small Business Administration), however, has a different threshold. If you&#8217;ve got a credit score of 650 or better, you&#8217;d probably have success at the SBA. With a credit score below 650, you probably will not find success with the SBA. Online lenders like OnDeck will work with a borrower who has a slightly lower credit score than that, provided they have a healthy business and can demonstrate that their business is able to repay the loan. Some lenders go as low as a credit score of 500, depending upon the circumstances.</p>
<p>Realistically, if you&#8217;re a borrower with a credit score of 600, you will likely pay more in interest than you would if you had a credit score of 700. You can&#8217;t go to the Bank and get a low-interest loan from the SBA or from the bank. Depending upon your credit worthiness, the interest you pay is likely going to be greater.</p>
<p><strong>Zink:</strong> In recent years, lenders have been conservative regarding opening the purse-strings to small business loans. Do you think the environment is changing?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel: </strong>From traditional sources, I don&#8217;t think it has rebounded. However, I think that online lenders and others have made it possible for small business owners to access capital to fuel growth and build healthy businesses. It&#8217;s a good time for small business owners right now.</p>
<p><strong>Zink:</strong> Is it a good idea to establish a line of credit while you can?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> If you never access borrowed funds and a situation comes up where this is necessary, you have absolutely no credit profile for a lender to evaluate. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve been in business for seven years. You have an opportunity to expand to a new location, but you need a million dollars to do it. If you&#8217;ve never borrowed, there&#8217;s no way for a lender to evaluate whether-or-not they&#8217;re going to loan to you. They pull up your credit profile and see no history. Lenders are looking at your past performance to make a judgment about what you&#8217;ll do in the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not advocating that you should just borrow to borrow. However, I think it makes sense to get a line of credit, use it and pay it back. Lenders want to see that you&#8217;re able to use credit appropriately and repay in a timely fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Zink:</strong> What about vendor relationships?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> You can build a credit profile with your vendors. Most vendors and suppliers offer credit to their best customers. Using 30 or 60-day terms paid in a timely fashion helps build your credit, provided that supplier or vendor reports to the credit bureaus.</p>
<p><strong>Zink: </strong>There are times when a lack of capital is the biggest constraint to growth.</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> You need to understand your credit situation and how easily it&#8217;s going to be for you to access capital. Results of a recent survey indicate if you pay attention to your credit profile, the odds of getting a loan are exponentially better. Human nature dictates that we improve what we pay attention to. It&#8217;s relatively straightforward to improve your business credit profile. Just like your credit score, paying your bills on time is probably the single biggest impact to whether your score is going up or down.</p>
<p><strong>Zink:</strong> What credit advice can you give to a new business?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> Build a business credit profile. Take advantage of suppliers who give you terms. Go to Home Depot or Staples and establish a business credit account. Purchase your supplies and make timely payments. When you need capital to fuel growth in your business, you&#8217;ll have a better chance of getting it because you have established a track record.</p>
<p><strong>Zink:</strong> Is there ever an instance where the business owner won&#8217;t have to personally guarantee a loan?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Zink: </strong>What is OnDeck&#8217;s response time for a loan approval?</p>
<p><strong>Kiisel:</strong> You can get an approval within an hour or so, and sometimes as quickly as a few minutes. You can have money in your bank account within a couple of days, often as soon as 24 hours. Getting an answer in an hour or two may sound insanely fast, but we use technology to help make those decisions, so it&#8217;s definitely possible.</p>
<p>To sum it up, borrowing can be expensive, but not borrowing can stunt your company&#8217;s growth. The key is to prepare ahead of time by developing and maintaining a strong credit profile. As you grow your business, determine how much money you need-and why. More important, make sure you will be able to pay it back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are so excited to share the winners for the OnDeck Seal of Approval Contest. For the second year in a row, OnDeck worked with Barbara Corcoran to give three entrepreneurs a $10,000 prize, courtesy of OnDeck, and a one-on-one coaching session with Barbara, to take their businesses to the next level.  We know how challenging both access to capital and marketing a business can be. That&#8217;s why we designed this contest with Barbara specifically for busy and passionate business owners.</p>
<p>OnDeck launched the contest in mid-October and asked small business owners “How would you use $10,000 and advice from Barbara Corcoran to grow your business?”</p>
<p>We received over 1,000 entries from amazing and dedicated small business owners across the country, but we could only pick three winners. With Barbara&#8217;s help, the finalists were chosen based on how compelling, unique and practical their response was. We were also looking for entrepreneurs who demonstrated a passion to grow their business.</p>
<p>The winners of the 2016 OnDeck Seal of Approval Contest are three innovative small businesses from diverse backgrounds:  Congratulations to Andrew Buerger from B&#8217;more Organic, Rachelle and Paul Baron from Beau &amp; Belle Littles, and Geoffrey Dean from Hardball Cider.</p>

<p>B’more Organic, an organic smoothie company founded by Jennifer and Andrew Buerger, promotes healthy living with a socially conscious mission. Dedicated to local, family-owned sustainable farming, B’more Organic smoothies use Skyr, an Icelandic yogurt packed with protein. One percent of sales benefit Jodi’s Climb for Hope, a non-profit dedicated to funding the development of a new viable treatment for breast cancer.

Beau &#038; Belle Littles, maker of reusable swim diapers, started out in 2015 in Loveland, CO. What began as a few well-designed and adorable swim alternatives for Rachelle and Paul Baron’s water-loving six-month-old, Beau, quickly developed into a top-selling Amazon product – the Nageuret Swim Diaper – which grossed $250,000 in the first year. The eco-friendly diaper manufacturer also donates 5% of their profits to Compassion International to help bring children and their parents out of poverty worldwide. Leveraging Barbara’s advice, the Baron family is looking to expand their reach, develop new product lines, and pinpoint the most cost-effective way to expand.</p>
<p><strong>HardBall Cider</strong><br />
Name: Geoffrey Deen<br />
Time in Business: 3 years<br />
Business Website: <a href="http://www.hardballcider.com/" target="_blank">www.hardballcider.com  </a><br />

HardBall Cider, driven by founder Geoffrey Dean’s passion for baseball and real hard cider, began three years ago in Mount Bethel, PA. The company’s three varieties of cider can now be found in the area’s local restaurants and, appropriately, in many of Pennsylvania’s major and minor league baseball stadiums. As an avid Shark Tank fan, Geoffrey hopes that Barbara can offer guidance on how to plan for controlled expansion across multiple market segments and to overcome his challenge of scaling production.</p>
