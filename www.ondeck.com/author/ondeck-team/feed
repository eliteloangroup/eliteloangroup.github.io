<p>The media outlet OnDeck recently announced Kingston Collision as its Small Business of the Month for December 2018.</p>
<p>Kingston Collision serves residents of Kingston, N.Y. and the Hudson Valley. The owner, David Rowe, opened the business after serving as a physical damage adjuster for 20 years.</p>
<p>Rowe used OnDeck as a lender to help him meet the shortfall until insurance companies released the funds on dozens of outstanding claims. He used the financing to purchase parts and inventory for customer repairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;With more than a decade of success and over $10 billion funded to small businesses online, we believe OnDeck&#8217;s technology is primed to revolutionize how small businesses finance their equipment needs,&#8221; said Noah Breslow, Chairman and CEO, OnDeck. &#8220;We expect OnDeck equipment finance loans to quickly become a vital source of online financing for small business owners seeking simple, transparent equipment financing they can understand and utilize.&#8221;</p>
<p>OnDeck also today announced the appointment of Mark Erickson as Vice President of Equipment Finance. Erickson is a veteran of the equipment finance market, previously serving in executive roles in sales, operations, syndications and risk at Key Equipment Finance, Inc., a unit of Key Corp. He was also the Managing Director of the firm&#8217;s Australia and New Zealand subsidiary from 2000 to 2004.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to working with the team to leverage OnDeck&#8217;s online originations and underwriting technology to deliver speed and convenience for small business owners seeking equipment finance loans,&#8221; Erickson said. &#8220;With speed, service and transparency, we are poised to transform this market to the benefit of small businesses.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Oct 22, 2018</em></p>
<p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">On Deck Capital, an online lender to small businesses, is teaming up with PNC Financial Services. On Deck’s pitch: Make loans to small businesses relatively quickly. It currently has $1 billion worth of loans on its balance sheet, but it can earn revenue by letting established banks use its underwriting technology. PNC, the eighth largest American bank, says using On Deck will cut costs, speed up lending and help find new customers. (JPMorgan Chase has worked with On Deck since 2016.)</p>
<p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">PNC’s small business customers should be able to get a loan through On Deck within hours. “By compressing weeks down to a couple of hours, and eventually minutes, you transform the way small business access capital,” Noah Breslow, On Deck’s chief executive, told Peter Eavis. (The service will also be open to businesses that aren’t PNC clients.)</p>
