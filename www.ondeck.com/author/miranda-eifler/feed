<p>In this post, one of OnDeck’s <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/partner/enterprise">strategic partners</a>, Angie’s List, shares time management tips for <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-101-marketing">marketing </a>and <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-101-customer-service-engagement">customer service</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>ANGIE’S LIST ON MARKETING</u>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give a business owner who can’t find time to devote to their marketing efforts?</strong><br />
Focus on one area of marketing that you really want to accomplish. Most people never start because they assume you need to do it all. First, do a little research. Get to know where your competitors are and what they are doing. Where are they advertising or receiving most of their business? Then take a good look at your own business to determine strengths and areas for improvement. You can develop marketing to support the areas that are already bringing in business and then provide more attention to additional campaigns as resources allow.</p>
<p><strong>Any other marketing best practices?<br />
</strong>Many small businesses want to start marketing their services right away but don’t know what to do first. Here are three things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;"><strong>Understand your audience</strong>: Knowing who your customers are and what they like helps you target an audience more likely to buy your services. Create a customer profile with age, gender, education level and income to help you prepare a marketing campaign that will engage your target audience.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;"><strong>Be social</strong>: Even if you don’t think you have the time to monitor or participate often in social media, it’s still important to secure your presence and be where your customers are engaging. Consider what social channel – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. – works best and makes the most sense for your brand, and use it as an opportunity to learn what customers think about you, respond to your comments, build your brand’s personality and, if you’re an Angie’s List service provider, gain credibility outside of our platform.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;"><strong>Gauge your success</strong>: Track where your customers are coming from so you know the effectiveness of each campaign. Set up online analytics, tracking phone numbers and unique offer codes to see if your customers are coming from social media, email, direct mail marketing or your website. This lets you know what’s working best, determine the cost and ROI of your efforts and allows you to adjust accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>ANGIE’S LIST ON CUSTOMER SERVICE</u>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you’d give a business owner who needs a more efficient customer service strategy?</strong><br />
Focus on the basics. Your core mission is to keep customers happy. As a top-rated business, customers expect you to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Return phone calls and emails in a timely manner.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Show up to appointments on time.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Listen to their concerns or feedback, and let them know you appreciate their business.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do you think small businesses struggle so often with efficient customer service?</strong><br />
Being a small business owner requires wearing multiple hats and there is only some much time in a day. It’s really important to build a support team, companies and individuals you can count on and team up with while you are growing the business.</p>
<p>In setting up your support team, consider your own expertise and the needs of your business. Figure out what kind of help makes the most sense for your situation. A great way to do this: networking. Don’t be afraid to reach out and connect with people that can help you advance your business.</p>
<p><strong><u>ABOUT ANGIE’S LIST</u>:</strong></p>
<p>Angie’s List is one of OnDeck’s <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/partner/enterprise">strategic partners</a>. They offer a variety of products and services to help businesses get noticed by local consumers all year long. Consumers can easily find top-rated businesses to hire through their multiple channels (the Angie’s List website, magazine and call center).

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Running a small business is no easy feat – as a business owner, you wear several hats to keep your day-to-day operations running smoothly all while strategizing for your business’ long term growth. But how do you find the time to get everything done?</p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/blog/what-would-you-do-with-33-hours-of-your-time-back/">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, 61% of business owners surveyed told us they’re constantly racing against the clock, 49% said work/life balance is an illusion and 86% said time management is critical to success. So, we’re launching a Time Management Series this week to help you be more efficient, sacrifice less personal time and get one step closer to achieving that elusive work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll hear from OnDeck’s Chief Marketing Officer Andrea Gellert on how to manage time effectively when it comes to marketing.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>So you’ve spent an enormous amount of time and effort getting your business off the ground and now it’s time to spread the word. But how do you attract customers and keep them coming back?</p>
<p>Before you map out your marketing strategy and consider the actual tactics you’ll employ (digital advertising, social media engagement, email marketing, local circulars, etc.), your first step is to really key in on who your customer is. Who are they, what is their need and how does your solution fit that need?</p>
<p>Once you have a clear understanding of your customer, you can put your marketing action plan in place and identify where you can find your customers and how to target them. “Effectively marketing your business requires a little strategic thinking and experimenting with the tactics that will work with your customers, and then executing your marketing plan,” says OnDeck’s Chief Marketing Officer Andrea Gellert.</p>
<p>Read on for more expert tips from our resident marketing guru:</p>
<p><strong>How do you approach setting your marketing strategy?</strong><br />
To help set the strategy, I typically start by asking myself five key questions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">What are the overall company goals and how should our marketing efforts support them?</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Has anything about our marketing vision changed or been modified that I should take into consideration?</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">What can be short-term wins and what are longer-term investments?</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">What does success look like and what are the key metrics of success?</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">What are our key dependencies to succeed?</li>
</ol>
<p>Setting strategy is all about creating clarity, focus and purpose to achieve your goals, and these questions really help me get there efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>What time management best practices have you developed to keep OnDeck’s marketing department running efficiently?</strong><br />
The key is in prioritizing. It’s easy to get distracted with 1,000 ideas, but you can really only execute well on 1 or 2 at a time. So, focus on the 1-2 areas that have the potential to have the most impact on your business. Then, to make sure you manage your time well, create a to-do list and set deadlines as part of your daily or weekly schedule.</p>
<p>Additionally – and this doesn’t only apply to marketing – I encourage everyone to keep meetings short. Chances are that 1 hour meeting really only needs to be 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Would you recommend any software programs that streamline marketing?</strong><br />
First and foremost, get your business online. As important as it is to seek out your customers, you also want to make it easy for them to find you. And there are a variety of resources available to help get you set up online quickly and inexpensively:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Set up a website with a service like Wix or GoDaddy. You don’t need a web design background to set up a professional-looking website!</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">List your business online on platforms like Yelp or Google Places.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Make sure your NAP (Name, address and Phone #) is consistent across business directories</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Get some links to your website from other local businesses or organizations</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Make sure you’re on social media and using the right amplification tools. For example, Facebook’s Power Editor tool allows you to reach your end user in a more targeted and efficient way than a traditional timeline boost gives you. And, services like Hootsuite allow you to schedule your social posts in advance.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">If you regularly communicate with your customers electronically, automate your email streams using a service like Mailchimp or Constant Contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Automation helps save time and maximize marketing resources so you can focus on other areas of your business. What’s more, these services come with analytics tools so you can see in real time how effective your campaigns are and where you might need to make improvements.</p>
<p><strong>What are you favorite marketing books?</strong><br />
I know it can be hard to find time to read, but if you do have time, here are a few marketing books to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">&#8220;Why Things Catch On&#8221; by Jonah Berger. This book explores the science between “viral” marketing and provides tips on how to create content that will spread like wildfire.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">&#8220;Growth Hacker Marketing: A Primer on the Future of PR, Marketing, and Advertising&#8221; by Ryan Holiday. Learn how to achieve marketing success regardless of the size of your marketing budget.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">&#8220;Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping – the Global Consumer, and Beyond&#8221; by Paco Underhill. For all the retail small businesses out there, this book will give you tips on ensuring you’re engaging your existing customers and bringing in new ones with your products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any final advice on marketing and time management?</strong><br />
As I talk to small business owners, one of the main things I hear is that they have a lot of marketing ideas but just don’t have the time to execute them. I actually don’t think that’s the real issue. I think it’s that small businesses have felt that in the past it’s been hard to justify spending their time on marketing because it wasn’t always clear what the return would be. But in this day and age, that doesn’t have to be true, and the examples above all contain straightforward ways of measuring impact.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s so important to create systems and delegate work to free up your time. David Bobbitt, president of The SCORE Foundation, offered tips in <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-tips-from-scores-david-bobbitt">his guest post last week</a> around getting help – whether it’s by hiring employees or using a virtual assistant, short-term contractor or service provider. Regardless, don’t feel like you have to be doing everything yourself!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Running a small business is no easy feat – as a business owner, you wear several hats to keep your day-to-day operations running smoothly all while strategizing for your business’ long term growth. But how do you find the time to get everything done?</p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/blog/what-would-you-do-with-33-hours-of-your-time-back/">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, 61% of business owners surveyed told us they’re constantly racing against the clock, 49% said work/life balance is an illusion and 86% said time management is critical to success. So, we’re launching a Time Management Series this week to help you be more efficient, sacrifice less personal time and get one step closer to achieving that elusive work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll hear from OnDeck’s Customer Service Director Eric Lichtenwalter and VP of Customer Success Shannon Smith on how to manage time effectively when it comes to serving your customers.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Customer Service really comes down to keeping your customers happy so they not only come back but also recommend your business to their friends and family. To achieve this, start by making things personal. As a business owner, this should be relatively easy for you – and chances are, you’re already one step ahead.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a restaurant owner, you likely remember the favorite dishes of your regular patrons; if you own a retail shop, you know your regular shoppers’ names and tastes; or if you run an auto shop, you recognize your repeat customers’ vehicles and maintenance histories.</p>
<p>As great as these personal connections are, they don’t happen overnight and are just one part of how you interact with your customers. In today’s post, OnDeck’s customer experts – Eric Lichtenwalter, Director of Customer Service, and Shannon Smith, VP of Customer Success – share their time management best practices for customer service and engagement.</p>
<p><strong><u>CUSTOMER SERVICE</u>: Q&#038;A with Eric Lichtenwalter, OnDeck’s Customer Service Director<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>What areas of customer service take up more time than others?</strong><br />
There are two things we try to focus on: issues that keep occurring, and customers that continue calling with the same question.</p>
<p>For issues that keep occurring, I always ask, “Why do people contact OnDeck’s customer service?” This will help determine if it’s related to our products or the way something is worded on our website, for example. If we can isolate the root cause, we can figure out the right solution so recurring calls on the same issue don’t happen.</p>
<p>For customers that keep calling, we want to make sure they aren’t calling with the same question they had in their previous interaction. That’s not the best use of their time, or ours. But if it happens, it’s a matter of making sure our customer service agents are providing the right information and anticipating follow-up questions that can arise later. The key here is to be well prepared for anything.</p>
<p><strong>What time management best practices have you developed to keep the customer service department running efficiently?</strong><br />
Staffing to your customer volume history and/or foot traffic trends is very important. As a business owner, you know when your busiest times are and should therefore staff accordingly. Additionally, it’s important to know how to manage a call or interaction so it doesn’t take longer than it needs to but isn’t so short your customers will feel cast aside. Train your staff to know how to meet their needs and come to a resolution efficiently – whether that’s creating a FAQs script or putting protocols in place for different types of interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Would you recommend any software programs that streamline customer service?</strong><br />
A good Customer Relations Management (CRM) tool is a must – it allows you to securely store customer information, track your interactions and make any necessary notes you may need in the future. That way, each new interaction with a customer will be more familiar and more personal – increasing the likelihood of them remaining a customer and recommending your business to a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a go-to customer service book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“The Effortless Experience” by Matthew Dixon and Rick Delisi.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“Setting the Table” by Danny Meyers – a great book on customer service and restaurants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you achieve work/life balance?</strong><br />
I’ve been fortunate to work for great companies that promote a strong work/life balance. To be honest, I probably won’t take a job without a strong culture and support around a work/life balance. I have two kids, and when I go home I focus on the family. I’m not against checking emails before I go to bed, or over the weekend, but it should be around checking for any fires. My trick is to keep an ongoing list for what I need to accomplish each day or each week. As long as I check all the boxes (or at least the high priority ones!) I can unplug during my family time.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else to share as it relates to customer service and time management?</strong><br />
It all revolves around the team. We have an amazing customer service team that puts my mind at ease. I know I can trust them to make the right decisions, and if anything doesn’t go as planned, we learn from our experience and improve from there.</p>
<p><strong><u>CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT</u>: Q&#038;A with Shannon Smith, OnDeck’s VP of Customer Success<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>What time management best practices have you developed to keep your customer success efforts running efficiently?</strong><br />
Prioritize projects that will have the biggest impact on the customer experience, and as a result, your business’ overall results. Focusing your time and resources there will be well worth it in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Would you recommend any books that relate to efficient customer success practices?</strong><br />
“The Loyalty Effect” by Fred Reichheld is the classic guide written by the creator of the Net Promoter Score (NPS). While it’s a little dated (from 1996), most of the concepts are still relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us more about NPS.</strong><br />
If you don’t measure your business’ NPS, I encourage you to do so. NPS measures how likely your customers are to recommend your business to a friend and provides a great opportunity for you to understand any recurring pain points to address as well as great features and/or experiences to do more of. You can start by sending a two-question survey:</p>
<ol>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">How likely are you to recommend [your business name] to a friend? <i>Multiple Choice Response: Scale of 1 (unlikely) to 10 (very likely)</i></li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">What are your primary reasons for giving the score you did in question 1? <i>Open text response</i></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How do you achieve work/life balance?</strong><br />
The three keys for me are prioritizing effectively, delegating when appropriate, and writing everything down! It enables me to feel more efficient with my work time. If something is important to me, I block the time on my calendar as far in advance as possible and protect the time no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else to share as it relates to customer success and time management?</strong><br />
One benefit we try to offer to customers is useful content to help them manage their businesses more effectively. But we know how busy small business owners are, so we often send out bite-sized bits of business and credit advice in various monthly emails and newsletters, hoping this is a more digestible way to help them. So, think about small ways you can engage your customers that together can have a big impact on their experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Running a small business is no easy feat – as a business owner, you wear several hats to keep your day-to-day operations running smoothly all while strategizing for your business’ long term growth. But how do you find the time to get everything done?</i></p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/what-would-you-do-with-33-hours-of-your-time-back">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, 61% of business owners surveyed told us they’re constantly racing against the clock, 49% said work/life balance is an illusion and 86% said time management is critical to success. So, we’re launching a Time Management Series this week to help you be more efficient, sacrifice less personal time and get one step closer to achieving that elusive work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll hear from OnDeck’s Senior Vice President of People Operations Lorna Hagen and our Director of Talent Acquisition Danelle Dilibero on how to efficiently build and grow a team.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>One of the reasons business owners are so strapped for time is because there is so much to do and – in most cases – not enough people to get it all done. And as businesses grow, so too does the work. So it’s no surprise that one of the uses for OnDeck loans is hiring and retaining employees. Having an extra set of hands – whether full time, part time, contract or freelance – can make a world of difference.</p>
<p>But finding the time to devote to hiring and building a People practice can be challenging. The key is to be focused and deliberate about the role(s) you need, the ideal candidate(s) and what the onboarding process will include. Your reward? More help at work, which means more time for you.</p>
<p>To help streamline your HR to-do list, OnDeck’s recruiting director and head of People Operations share their people time management tips:</p>
<p><strong><u>RECRUITING</u></strong>:<strong> Q&amp;A with Danelle Dilibero, OnDeck’s Director of Talent Acquisition</strong></p>
<p><strong>What areas of recruiting take up more time than others?</strong><br />
Evaluating candidates takes time – and rightly so. I always say “Measure Twice, Cut Once” when it comes to interviewing. You don’t want to hire someone based on just one meeting or one interaction. It’s worth having at least two people meet your candidate (you and a trusted friend/advisor/employee) or have two different interactions (such as once on the phone and once in person). Having more than one perspective will allow for you to have multiple data points to help make better decisions.</p>
<p>Additionally, don’t hire the first person you meet. And don’t hire the friend of a friend just because of the connection. You’ll say no to more people than you’ll say yes to, which is never easy but it’s important to remember that the wrong hire can hurt your business and your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>What time management best practices have you developed to make your recruiting efforts more efficient?</strong><br />
Always, always, always set a timeline and action plan for hiring:</p>
<ol>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Post your job and ask that all applications/resumes be submitted by a certain day. Deadlines are key.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Give yourself a few business days to read all the job submissions and make notes about each candidate, asking yourself the following questions: What experience does the candidate have that you are looking for, or didn&#8217;t realize you may need? What does the candidate say that is interesting to you? What do you want to know more about? What do you want the candidate to expand upon if/when you meet him or her? What&#8217;s missing from the candidate&#8217;s experience?</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Send a note to all candidates, including the ones you want to speak to and even the ones that you don’t plan on moving forward with. These candidates might wind up being customers in the future and you want to make sure they have a good experience with your brand.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">For those you plan on speaking with, have your questions ready. And make sure you have a set of questions you ask everyone so you can easily assess one candidate from the next.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Ask your friend/advisor/employee to ask different questions than you’re asking so that they can assess for different attributes. This allows you to take a step back and hear a different point of view.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Finally, don’t hire yourself. It’s easy to hire someone who is just like you but that may not be what your business needs. Perhaps you need a skill set you don’t have, so find the person who can fill a void to round-out your staff and help you grow your business better.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Would you recommend any software programs or online resources that streamline recruiting?</strong><br />
Most small business owners have websites and Facebook pages dedicated to their business, but they could be missing one of the best online resources: a LinkedIn profile. It’s easy to create a profile and network of peers, clients, mentors and friends. Then, when the business has a job opening, you can let your LinkedIn network know – and the best part? It’s free!</p>
<p>In addition to sharing with your LinkedIn network, it’s always a good idea to also mention the opening on your other social channels. You’d be surprised how many referrals you’ll get.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a go-to recruiting book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“Hire With Your Head” by Lou Adler</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“Who” by Geoff Smart and Randy Street</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you achieve work/life balance?</strong><br />
Balance indicates that when one thing is up, another must be down – like a see-saw. Instead, try to find congruence. To do so, it is important to think about how to draw the line between your professional requirements and personal needs, and then set boundaries accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else to share as it relates to recruiting and time management?</strong><br />
You are hiring someone because you need the extra help. Remember to let go a little, give your new hire the chance to take things over, do things their way and quite possibly, teach you something new.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong><u>MANAGING HR, AKA YOUR PEOPLE OPERATIONS</u>: Q&amp;A with Lorna Hagen, OnDeck’s Senior Vice President of People Operations</strong></p>
<p><strong>What time management best practices have you developed to keep the people ops department running efficiently?</strong><br />
First, crystal clear communication – it always answers the “why” for people and eliminates the need for too much back and forth (which inevitably wastes time!). When you communicate clearly, your employees get onboarded more quickly and better understand your strategy and vision from the get-go. This is key in developing loyalty.</p>
<p>The second is that each specialized People Operations department – including recruiting, people development, etc. – has a dedicated director with deep subject matter expertise who is empowered to make decisions in real time. Whether or not you have dedicated teams to manage, the key is to empower each employee to make a difference in support of your vision.</p>
<p><strong>Would you recommend any software programs or online resources that keep People Operations running efficiently?</strong><br />
Software programs/apps I use and like are Unstuck for iPad, MindTools and Small Improvements. Of course, depending on your specific needs you should carefully consider what types of tools fit best.</p>
<p>I read a variety of blogs as well, including HR Bartender, Laurie Ruettimann, Fistful of Talent, Bob Sutton Work Matters and The Labor &amp; Employment Law Blog.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a go-to book about managing people?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“Great People Decisions” by Claudio Fernandez Araoz</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“Work Rules!” By Laszlo Bock</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">“Setting the Table” by Danny Meyer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you achieve work/life balance?</strong><br />
Ultimately, you have to be okay with the compromises you will make at work and in life. The only people I know in perfect harmony are full time meditation experts. The rest of us mortals need to make trade-offs to accommodate our priorities – and it’s important to simply accept these trade-offs and keep moving forward.</p>

But how do you find the time to get everything done? Check out these time management tips from David Bobbitt.</i></p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/what-would-you-do-with-33-hours-of-your-time-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, 61% of business owners surveyed told us they’re constantly racing against the clock, 49% said work/life balance is an illusion and 86% said time management is critical to success. So, we’re launching a Time Management Series this week to help you be more efficient, sacrifice less personal time and get one step closer to achieving that elusive work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll hear from David Bobbitt, president of The SCORE Foundation, on his time management tips and work/life balance best practices. <a href="https://core.score.org/ondeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORE </a>is a non-profit organization comprised of 11,000+ volunteer mentors who provide free and confidential small business mentoring and advice.</p>
<p><strong>GUEST POST FROM DAVID BOBBITT:<br />
</strong><br />
At first glance, I am the last person who should ever write a guide for work efficiency. But according to people who know me, I do cover well. So rather than say “hey, here are all the solutions,” read this more as “hey, here are my long list of challenges,” plus some strategies that help me get by.</p>
<p>Big picture first….when you start and run your own business, contrary to expectations, you are simultaneously your own boss and rarely your own boss. By that I mean to do well, you need to enforce discipline around your behaviors. If being your own boss means eating ice cream sandwiches all day while binge-watching Netflix, well let me tell you from personal experience that’s not a good way to grow your business! You get to choose what order you do things in and if and when to get help, but most business functions must occur regularly—bookkeeping, sales calls, inventory, you name it—and those functions are truly the small business owner’s boss.</p>
<p>I had to learn that it was OK to ask for help, a sign of strength, not of weakness. My first business involved renovating and flipping real estate. I was young and stronger than I look. Many times I had to hire people to help me with technical repairs beyond my experience. At first I convinced myself that I would watch them work, say adding circuit breakers to an electrical panel, and learn that task well enough never to need that specific help again. One day—and bear with me because I’m slow—I realized that if I relied on strong professionals who could do part of the job that I’m not so hot at, I could focus on the tasks where my presence is most value added. Which brings me to…</p>
<p><strong>Delegating</strong>. One of the first things a small business owner has to do is to delegate. Now this may not mean hiring employees. Getting help from a virtual assistant, short-term contractor (like my electrician), or a service provider like an accountant can help keep you on track to achieve your goals while still ensuring you get a good night’s sleep on a regular basis. Pitfall to avoid: When you think you are your own best accountant, attorney, electrician, or finance guru—and you don’t have a background in that field—you aren’t! It’s OK to ask for help, and never a sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>. Everyone says that technology helps us be more productive. As Netflix and the video games on my iPad can attest, technology for me often helps me be less productive as well. But let me mention some of the technology-based solutions I use:</p>
<p>1.) Many new business owners are unaware that SCORE offers <a href="https://www.score.org/content/live-and-recorded-webinars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded webinars</a> that can be accessed any time, day or night. We know that many business owners can’t carve out an hour in the middle of the workday to join us for a live webinar, but each gets archived and can be accessed absolutely free. Whether it’s a session about how to access capital or ways to use social media platforms wisely, we cover it all. I can’t recommend these webinars enough &#8211; they’re such a valuable resource and we’re proud to offer them for free. Binge watch and learn!</p>
<p>2.) <a href="http://www.tripcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripCase</a> is an app I started using at my consulting business. It’s great for putting all the components of a trip—flight, hotel, car—in one handy location and it generates calendar items for my calendar. TripCase helps me get the most out of any travel. There are likely other apps out there too that can help, so you should check them out to see which works for you.</p>
<p>3.) <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meet-me-in-the-middle/id826982528?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meet Me In The Middle</a> is a great app when you need to set up meetings or meet with a group of people and want to find somewhere halfway for everyone. Just enter each address, and you can figure out what’s halfway. My business team was virtual, so when we decided to meet, it wasn’t as easy as walking down the hall to the water cooler.</p>
<p>4.) Notes for iPhone is one of the best efficiency products ever. All my Notes are synched, so I can take notes anywhere and always be able to find them again using a simple search from any of my devices. Since my memory is sometimes a bottleneck—don’t laugh, it will happen to you one day too—I like the ease of searching Notes.</p>
<p>5.) Social media marketing tools. This is a good news/bad news item in my book. It’s easier than ever to promote your business through social media and online advertising tools, but truly marketing your company requires attention and great care in developing your brand and message. There’s no way to go through the motions just to get it done, like you could do with bookkeeping or perhaps operational tasks. Developing blog posts, social media content, and other forms of marketing can be cost effective, but can take a great deal of time and focus.</p>
<p>6.) Excel. I ran a real estate business for seven years on Microsoft Excel. It is still my go-to tool for figuring out budgets and making estimates. It’s even easier to use today thanks to quick and easy Excel tutorials available on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong>. When I was deeply into my last business, I was a member of a “CEO support group” of peers. It was one of the best experiences of my life. Every business owner needs a support system — it goes back to seeing asking for help as a sign of strength, not weakness. A support system made up of family, friends, and/or colleagues can prevent you from getting tunnel vision as you work toward your business goals. At the same time, they can help motivate you to complete business tasks you’ve been avoiding. Many new entrepreneurs find their SCORE mentors to be helpful in this regard. A mentor is someone who understands the rigors and stresses of starting a business, but also knows that an exhausted business owner isn’t going to accomplish much. A mentor can provide gentle reminders to business owners to be kind to themselves, while also looking for ways to streamline the small business workload and systems.</p>
<p><strong>Last Word</strong>. I had to learn to become patient with myself, and I urge any small business owner to cultivate patience for himself or herself. A new business owner is overwhelmed with not just the possibilities of entrepreneurship, but also with the long to-do lists required to achieve those possibilities. Get to know your working style and find ways to improve it — and don’t sweat what the books and experts say too much. There are a ton of helpful tips out there, for sure, but not every tip works for every business owner. Don’t get hung up on that. Figure out your own strengths, and play to them. Like me, you may never be a paragon of efficiency. But you can learn to be your best as well as your most productive.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>33 hours. According to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that is how long it takes – on average – to apply for a loan from a traditional lender. But let’s be honest: as a business owner, you don’t have that kind of time.</p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/news/ondeck-announces-initiative-to-help-small-business-owners-with-time-management-issues">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, we set out to learn what exactly you would do with 33 hours of your time back.</p>
<p>And one thing is clear: you are constantly racing against the clock. Read on for our study’s key findings, and tune in to OnDeck’s Facebook page over the next couple of weeks for a series of time management resources to help you run your business more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>So, What Would a Business Owner Do with 33 Hours Back?<br />
</strong>For small business owners, the summer months can be especially busy, with 44 percent citing summer as their busiest season. One-third of business owners will not take a vacation this summer, but according to our survey, that’s not the top priority – instead, the majority of respondents (43 percent) said they would choose to take those 33 theoretical hours to spend quality time with family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Small Business Owners and Time: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">After spending quality time with friends and family, business owners would use 33 hours of their time back to invest in their business (24 percent), take a vacation (22 percent), pursue an extra-curricular passion outside of work (7 percent) and give back to their local community (3 percent).</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">Of those not taking a vacation this summer, 33 percent say they can’t leave their business for a long period of time, while 23 percent say they don’t have anyone they can trust to run their business while away.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">To keep their business running, roughly half (49 percent) of the business owners surveyed say they’ve sacrificed personal time and an additional 33 percent say they’ve skimped on time with friends and family. Meanwhile, 10 percent say they’ve sacrificed their health because they don’t have enough time to exercise or go to the doctor.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">One-third of those surveyed said they’d need an average of 69 hours per week to be successful – well above the national average work week of 47 hours.</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">In addition to applying for credit, small business owners say other time-intensive areas of running a business include customer service (42 percent), marketing (41 percent), accounting (33 percent) and people operations/HR (31 percent).</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">If given access to a freelancer or intern, they’d use the extra set of hands for administrative work (33 percent), greeting customers (18 percent) and running social media accounts (15 percent).</li>
<li style="color: #3c3c3c;">All in all, 86 percent agree that exceptional time management is mandatory for business success, with 49 percent describing work/life balance as an illusion, not a reality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reclaiming Time<br />
</strong>So how can business owners achieve some semblance of balance?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2007, OnDeck has been transforming the way small businesses access capital, using our proprietary technology and small business credit scoring system, the <em>OnDeck Score</em>®, to efficiently evaluate a business’ creditworthiness and make targeted lending decisions in real time. So how do we actually do this? Keep reading to learn more about our OnDeck <em>Score</em> and how it works.</p>
<p>The OnDeck <em>Score</em> is a better alternative to personal credit scores for assessing Main Street’s credit health. Purpose-built for small business, the OnDeck <em>Score</em> looks at more than 2,000 data points to create an accurate business credit profile. These data range from cash flow and transactional data to public records to our own extensive internal historical performance data.</p>
<p>Small businesses are diverse and have complex data footprints, making it difficult for traditional lenders to efficiently underwrite their loan applications. Looking at the distinct cash flow profiles pictured below, it’s easy to see that the loan application for a restaurant will look very different from that of a landscaper or plumber. Without technology or a standardized small business credit score, many traditional lenders rely on manual underwriting and offline document collection (which is onerous and takes too much time) as well as a business owner’s personal FICO score (which may prove a poor proxy for the health of the underlying business).</p>
<p>The OnDeck <em>Score</em>, our advanced lending technology, and our database of 10 million small businesses enable us to analyze risk and more precisely underwrite businesses across over 700 different industries, including restaurants, landscapers and plumbers. Our approach has been tried and tested in the US market since 2007, and we are currently on the fifth generation of our OnDeck <em>Score</em> – with each version more predictive than the last.</p>

<p>Since 2007, OnDeck has delivered more than $4 billion across the United States, Canada and Australia. We are committed to increasing Main Street’s access to capital and will continue innovating our platform, products and service to meet our customers’ financing needs so they can focus on what’s most important to them – their customers.</p>

The 40 Under 40 is <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/40under40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crain’s annual list</a> celebrating the accomplishments of 40 people who have achieved great success in business before their 40th birthday. This year, OnDeck’s first employee and now our CEO, Noah Breslow, was chosen by a panel of editors at Crain’s as part of this year’s list of high achievers.</p>
<p>Noah joined OnDeck in 2007 prior to the most challenging economic period in the U.S. since the Great Depression, spending the last 10 years dedicated to helping small businesses access the capital they need to fuel growth and fund their cash flow needs. By leveraging technology to streamline and simplify time-consuming, paper-based small business lending processes, Noah and OnDeck have put over $2 billion into the hands of business owners since 2007.</p>
<p>Small business lending is an important part of helping small businesses make communities strong and our economy grow. A recent study conducted by the Analysis Group for OnDeck found that OnDeck’s first $1 billion in loans created 22,000 jobs and $3.43 billion in economic impact in the U.S.</p>
<p>Join us in congratulating Noah.</p>
