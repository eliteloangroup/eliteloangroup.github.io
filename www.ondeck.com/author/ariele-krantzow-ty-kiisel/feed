								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Readers,<br />
We hope you had a truly enjoyable Thanksgiving holiday. We wanted to take this Thanksgiving week to tell all of you how much we appreciate everything you do as business owners. You are our inspiration, and the reason we strive to share informative, relevant articles, videos and guides every week.</p>
<p>Small business is a big part of our lives. Both of us have had to roll up our sleeves to make a small business work; and are motivated to share our experiences with content that might help your business run a little more smoothly and share the information so that you can make the most informed decisions about business financing possible.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re proud to contribute a little to what youâ€™re doing.</p>
<p>We are real advocates of small business and recognize that your business is part of the engine that drives the US economy. Collectively over half of our friends and neighbors work in businesses like yours and we hope you have a successful Small Business Saturday.</p>
<p>All of us at OnDeck plan on patronizing our favorite small businesses this weekend and look forward to sharing with you over the coming weeks our Small Business Saturday experiences.</p>
<p>How did you spend your Small Business Saturday? Share your experiences in the comments below.</p>
<p>Our warmest regards,</p>
<p>Ty Kiisel &amp; Ariele Krantzow</p>
