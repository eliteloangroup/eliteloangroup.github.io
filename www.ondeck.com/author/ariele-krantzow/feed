								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tax day in coming up and we hear a lot from small business owners who mix up what they actually need to file for their personal taxes over their quarterly estimated taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spoke with expert CPA, Ofer Gabbay, head of </span><a target="_blank" href="http://gabbayco.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ofer E. Gabbay &amp; Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> located in New Jersey who deals with many types of accounting including small and family-run businesses. He shared his insights on several complications small business owners may face when filing their personal taxes.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is the biggest misconception small business owners have about filing personal taxes?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The biggest misconception is in regards to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> amount of tax they will owe. Many business owners don’t realize the deductions available to them with proper planning. Make sure you do your research and talk with a professional to ensure you are doing the most you can to optimize your deductions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is the biggest mistake small business owners make when filing their personal taxes?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not seeking professional advice during the year and waiting until the following year to ask the questions. Business owners have a lot on their plate, but don’t put off asking questions about your taxes, the earlier you sort everything out the better.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333"><b>What are the 3 things you think every small business owner should know about filing their personal taxes and why?</b></span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> You legally must file a return, even if you can’t afford to pay the tax due.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> Plan, plan, plan, with proper planning and the correct advice, small business owners can save thousands of dollars in taxes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> My personal feeling, you don’t need to spend foolish money to save on taxes.  You should always consider economics before taxes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ofer Gabbay is the o<span class="lt-line-clamp__line">wner and president of Ofer E. Gabbay &amp; Co., CPA PC, an accounting firm located in </span><span class="lt-line-clamp__line">Hackensack, NJ. He has been offering professional accounting &amp; tax services to individuals and small to </span><span class="lt-line-clamp__line lt-line-clamp__line--last">medium size companies for over 20 years.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You’ve looked over all your options and you’ve decided to apply for business financing. You may be wondering what factors are used to evaluate your business’ creditworthiness.  Your business credit profile is a big part of this evaluation. We get questions about business credit all the time from what is business credit? And how do I find out where it is? To what you can do to positively influence your score? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are all the <em><strong>most frequently asked questions we get about business credit</strong></em>, laid out in one nifty article. </span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">1.</span> What is business credit? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your personal credit score is a measurement tool used by creditors to determine your creditworthiness as an individual; your </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/business-credit-score"><span style="font-weight: 400">business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> profile is a tool used to establish a baseline of  your business’ ability to pay back a loan.</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">2</span>. How can I establish business credit?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once your business is established, be it an LLC, partnership, corporation,sole proprietorship etc. your business credit profile is created. Part of your profile is information about your business included in the public record, so the information you shared with the state or county where you registered your business winds up being the beginnings of your profile. Like your personal credit score, creditors can review your score. Unlike your personal credit score, your business credit profile is public, so anyone who wants to can take a look at it.  And, like your personal credit score there are several things that can impact your business credit profile, positively or negatively.</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">3.</span> How can I create a strong business credit profile?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Building a </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/easiest-ways-to-strong-business-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400">strong business credit profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> should be a priority for any business owner. If you’re a new business think of yourself as a teenager who wants to apply for their first credit card. You’ll likely to have to start small and build your business credit from there. </span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #ffffff">Many suppliers offer  30, 60 or 90 day credit terms to their best customers It’s important to make sure you always pay on time, because this is an important first step to building a good credit profile. Just make sure they report your good payment history to the business credit bureaus, if not, you’re building credit with that supplier, but not doing anything to positively to impact your business credit profile generally.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #ffffff">A fairly easy way to start building your business credit is to apply for a business credit card and make sure to pay the statement balance every time it’s due.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #ffffff">If you don’t have a business that uses suppliers  that offer credit terms, or your business does not require goods that you resell, you can set up similar terms with big box office supplies stores that offer many of the supplies that most small businesses use, and will often offer business credit to small businesses like yours. Think of the stores that sell cleaning supplies and other office supplies the average business regularly uses.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #ffffff">If you’re a more established business, and have been already following the above three suggestions, you can start by getting a business loan for a small amount that you can easily manage to pay off. (Remember make sure you have an actual purpose for the loan before you take it, don’t just take a loan for the sake of building credit.)</span></li></ol>		</div>
		
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">4.</span> Where can I go to see my business credit profile?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many places you can go to to </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/heres-find-business-credit-score"><span style="font-weight: 400">view your business credit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">profile. All of the credit bureaus will give your access to view your score. In fact, because they want to ensure the information they have about your business is accurate, it makes sense to regularly review your profile and they all offer a means to do it.  A perk of business credit is that there is no penalty for inquiring about business credit profile. </span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">5.</span> What are the main business credit bureaus?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The biggest business credit bureaus are Experian, Equifax, and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet </span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">6.</span> How often should I check my business credit profile?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m a bit conservative, but I believe it’s a good idea to check up on your profile monthly. It’s the easiest way to catch errors and fix and issues before they go on too long. We tend to impact the things we pay the most attention to and monthly is not too frequent.</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">7.</span> How can I improve my business credit profile?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If your business credit profile is not where you want it to be don’t worry. You can improve it, it just takes a bit of effort. </span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #83eece;">
			<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400">Pay off your business credit card often to keep your debt ratio down. Don’t wait for your monthly statement to come, pay it off each week. It’s pretty simple now that you can do it all online or even on your phone. </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400">Pay in full any outstanding debt you have. Owe money to a creditor? If you have the means, pay it off as quickly as possible.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t close any credit accounts you have, the length of your credit history matters.</span></li></ol>		</div>
		
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, your business credit profile includes both positive and negative notations about your business credit history. Ultimately, the goal is to have more positives than negatives in your profile</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="color: #0074ff">8.</span> Does time in business affect my business credit profile?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your time in business doesn’t necessarily impact your credit profile, but if your business is still in the idea stage or less than a year or two old, it can make it difficult to get a small business loan. A strong profile that shows a history of your ability to use credit and service debt can positively impact your profile. In other words,, the </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/does-my-businesss-age-impact-its-credit-profile"><span style="font-weight: 400">longer your credit history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the more information there is in your credit profile to analyze your creditworthiness—particularly if you have a good track record. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the holiday season comes to a close, it’s normal to feel a little burnt out. No matter which industry you’re in, it can seem like a mad dash to the end of the year. For business owners, there’s more than enough on your plate with your regular day-to-day tasks and </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/have-this-year-be-your-best-year-ever"><span style="font-weight: 400">planning for the coming year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are 3 ideas to help you wind down after the holiday season ends:</span></h3>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Catch up with friends and family:</strong> No one close to a business owner is immune from the time commitment necessary to run a business. Take a few hours and catch up with friends and family. Make sure to let them know you appreciate them and their support.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Take a day to yourself:</strong> As a business owner you’re often giving your time to your business, your employees, and you give the leftovers to your family. Take a day and do what you want to do (with or without other people) go to a movie, go for a hike, get a massage, workout, or just plain do nothing. Leave work and the pressures of the year to come at the door for a day, and you’ll be surprised how good you’ll feel. </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Make a list of the “fun” things you want to do in the next year:</strong> As the wife of a small business owner, I find that if we write something down, it’s more likely to happen. We keep a list of fun activities we’d like to do together and somehow as the year ticks by we cross things off. (Pro tip: hang the list in a visible spot.)</span></li></ol>		</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By Lydia Beyoud | December 19, 2018 10:26AM ET</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Online small business lender OnDeck Capital plans to launch an equipment finance loan business in early 2019, applying its algorithmic know-how to the $35 billion market.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">OnDeck would become one of the first financial technology companies to enter the market, and the move could help it differentiate its business from a growing pool of fintech competitors in online small business lending.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">OnDeck uses an algorithmic underwriting process to offer loans to small businesses that are often neglected by traditional financial institutions. The technology hasn’t penetrated the equipment finance market in the same way, OnDeck CEO Noah Breslow said in a Dec. 19 press release.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“We believe OnDeck’s technology is primed to revolutionize how small businesses finance their equipment needs,” Breslow said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Banks, manufacturers and vendors provided the bulk of equipment financing in 2015, according to the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association. Independent finance companies was just 16% of the market, the trade group said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The small-ticket segment OnDeck is entering — for equipment loans under $250,000 — makes up about one third of $1 trillion of loans issued each year in the industry, the group said.</span></p>
<p>OnDeck projects its loans could fund medical, manufacturing, construction and office equipment purchases. The secured, fixed-rate loans will range from $5,000 to $100,000, payable over 2-year to 5-year terms, and will initially be available to OnDeck’s current customers in the U.S.<span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p>The new financing option may help OnDeck retain existing customers and hold loans on its books for longer periods.<span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p>The company used a pilot referral program earlier in 2018 to gauge customer interest in equipment financing. In 2019, OnDeck will begin originating the loans and holding them on its balance sheet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To wrap up Women Small Business Owners month (my favorite month of the year), the women of OnDeck wanted to give back to the undeniable force that is the growing group of intelligent, fearless women taking on their dreams and starting their own businesses. We&#8217;re excited that over the past 11 years, <a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/files/doc_library/file/2018-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of women-owned businesses surged 58%, while all businesses increased only 12%</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because investing in your success as business owners is why we wake up every morning, the female leaders at OnDeck wanted to pass along their advice, which helped them get to where they are today in their own careers.</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">The burden of proof, so to speak, on women is higher, so:</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">Make sure your numbers are detailed, comprehensive and that you know them inside and out.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">Create your own board of directors to ensure you have people who can give you advice, additional perspective, etc.</span></li></ul><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">—<strong>Andrea Gellert</strong>, Chief Revenue Officer</span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p><span class="s1">Have confidence in yourself that you can figure out how to accomplish what needs to be done, even if you haven’t done it before.  There is a now-famous and often-quoted Hewlett Packard internal report released several years ago stating that “men apply for a job when they meet 60&#037; of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100&#037; of them.” Women often assume they need expertise in something to do it well, when the fact is, they’re pretty good at figuring it out!  Triangulating a few relevant past experiences and some good old intuition will usually get you there.</span></p><p style="text-align: right"><span class="s1">—<strong>Shannon Smith</strong>, </span><span class="s1">SVP of Marketing</span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #0074ff;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">When we talk to successful and stable small businesses they all have very different ways of managing their businesses, but one thing they seem to have in common is that they set aside some of their earnings into a separate account to help them weather hard financial times. Doing this seems to help these small businesses survive past the notorious “5 year” mark.</span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span style="color: #ffffff"><span class="s1">—<strong>Tracey Varnell</strong>, </span><span class="s1">Director of Design Strategy</span></span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t worry about trying to do everything perfect and celebrate small wins… success is about the journey!</span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span class="s1">—<strong>Kelly Merrill</strong>, </span><span class="s1">SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis</span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">Cultivating mentors that you admire and respect is critically important<span style="color: #ffffff"><span class="s1">—</span></span>but don’t expect amazing mentors to just fall into your lap. You have to be proactive. </span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span style="color: #ffffff"><span class="s1">—<strong>Christin Spradley</strong>, </span><span class="s1">Head of External Affairs &amp; Associate General Counsel</span></span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leverage your strengths such as empathy, listening skills, or emotional intelligence, that are typically slated as skills where women outshine men, as a differentiator for your business and customers.</span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span class="s1">—<strong>Rudmila Rahman</strong>, </span><span class="s1">Director of Financial Institution Partnerships</span></p>		</div>
		
<p>Thank you to all the women small business owners who work hard every day. We look forward to continuing to serve you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #0074ff;">
			<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><em>“Metrics that Matter”</em> <em>is a four-part series designed to deliver a pathway and a practice to the most impassioned small business owners.  The ones that built their companies not because they had a background in business but a passion for delivering the kinds of products and services they clearly saw a need for delivered at a service level that was missing from the marketplace.  This series is designed to empower and elevate you and your team so that you can win the game.</em></span></p>		</div>
		
<p>If there was a World Series for metrics, the gross profit margin would be the odds-on favorite to do a series sweep and get it done in four games.  That’s because the gross profit margin can tell you which moves you can make to have your whole business avoid any unforced errors and hit a grand slam home run to clinch the series.  How can one number be so powerful?</p>
<p>The gross profit margin (GPM for short) isn’t just a number—it’s an indicator of how your business is operating currently, and a predictor of how your business will perform in the future. Once you master this metric, you will be able to understand the options that your business has in making the most suitable corrections or taking the right course for growth.</p>
<p>Many small business owners have followed a path that led them from a passionate vocation to a professional pursuit. The similarities are striking—it starts with an energetic interest that grows into a mastery of the domain.  Maybe you love cooking and food so you now have a restaurant, you took your love of bike riding and transitioned that love into a career by owning a bike shop or a bike touring company. Intense attention to a particular way of seeing that passionate interest took you on a journey from novice to expert.  It makes you an amazing resource for your clients and customers.  You are their “go-to” for anything that they need in that arena. That’s because you are highly competent and credible at what you do.  This translates into customer reviews that say things like “completely awesome” and “they know their stuff inside and out.”</p>
<h3><strong>WIIFM (what’s in it for me?)</strong></h3>
<p>Being completely awesome in the domain of your vocation is the best place to start growing your business but it’s not the whole story.  Here’s the part where I’m going to start talking about the numbers with you.  A fair percentage of you have just frowned. Stay with me here. I will get nerdy.  You might be thinking “WIIFM (what’s in it for me) if I stay and read through this.  Well, it could mean that next level breakthrough of understanding that will help you direct your business in a way that bring you relief from the torment of not knowing how to make the right decision about your business.  Not understanding the numbers and what they’re telling you is the secret anguish of the small business owner.  It’s the embarrassment of not knowing how to lead your team so that you can afford to give better benefits or give your best people that raise you know they deserve.  It’s being able to feel comfortable taking your family on a vacation and knowing that your business can make payroll while you’re gone.  You keep telling yourself that sometime, sometime soon you’ll do better, save some money or sell more so that you can make the leap to being more profitable. But that sometime soon never comes, not with how you’re doing things now.</p>
<p>What I know is that having facility with the GPM helps you lead your people better, make better decisions and sleep soundly at night.  Those are the benefits of understanding your GPM and managing from it appropriately. Interested now? Ok, let’s get started in making you a better leader, a better owner and a better financial manager.</p>
<h3><strong>What actually is my Gross Profit Margin (GPM) anyway?</strong></h3>
<p>Your GPM is a product of two things: your income (that’s often times all the sales that you make) and the cost of making your products (your direct labor and raw materials) called your “cost of goods sold” (COGS for short). Sometimes you’ll see this as Cost of Services in service-oriented companies but for our purposes we’re going to use COGS.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>What counts as income?</strong></h3>
<p>For clarification&#8211; Income for most small businesses is the amount of money the company makes from sales.  It can also include the money you take in for subletting some space to another company or any investments the company has made. For most businesses, any money that comes in the door is categorized as income.</p>
<p>COGS is categorized as direct labor and raw materials that go into a product. For clarification purposes that means any personnel who are working to make the product. That means if you are a cabinetry company, the engineer making the drawings, the fabricators who are building the product, the finishers who are finishing the product, the quality control inspectors who are ensuring that the product is well-built as intended and complete are all included in the COGS calculations. The data entry person who is managing the payroll inputs is classified as an expense, not as part of the COGS calculation.  Why? Because this person, although laboring to do a good job for you, isn’t necessary to make the product that you are selling.  Their efforts are classified as an expense that the business incurs as part of “the cost of doing business.”  We will talk about the difference between COGS and expenses later.</p>
<h3><strong>What counts as materials?</strong></h3>
<p>Materials are all of the components that go into making the products your company sells. If you are making cabinets, you’ll need to buy wood, nails, hinges and drawer pulls, finishing materials like paint or lacquer (water-based hopefully because it is more environmentally sound), all of the components that a company needs to make their product goes into the COGS bucket. The hallmark of raw materials is that a company takes one material and improves it somehow by adding other components or creating new value (like a product) out of a raw material. Just like a cabinetmaker does when they take wood panels and make them into cabinets.</p>
<p>What about shipping the product from the cabinet shop to the customer? Isn’t that part of COGS? No, shipping costs of getting the product to the store or to the business or individual who ordered the product is thought of as an expense, not part of COGS.  This is an important distinction and one of the key conversations about looking at the business expenses again lumped in with “the cost of doing business” that an owner often hears.</p>
<p>Why did we just get into the nitty gritty here with COGS? So many people take it for granted that the COGS is a dump bucket in your income statement for all kinds of expenses like shipping or marketing items but it really isn’t.  There is a lot of misinformation that small business owners have taken on that just isn’t correct and just doesn’t serve them.  In this case, the COGS oftentimes is one of these misunderstood categories in the income statement.  Here’s where you get great benefit from understanding why it is a disservice to the small business owner to not understand what large companies do.  Large companies put a lot of resources to work to maximize the value of their own information gathering and data. Why do large companies spend time, money and effort to reviewing their own data? Because it is key to asking and answering the right questions and then taking the appropriate action.  This is where financial data moves from a two-dimensional conversation to a three-dimensional one.</p>
<h3><strong>Your GPM Is a report on your management and purchasing skills</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s go back to your COGS. Remember that the two elements of your COGS number are direct labor and raw materials.  In a perfect world, these numbers should be stable.  It means that you’ve estimated correctly the amount of labor it takes to make your product and the amount of raw materials (including waste) that it takes to make your product.  That’s in a perfect world.  In reality, we have all sorts of variables that impact how much labor it takes to produce a product and how much raw materials are in use or how much they cost to make your product.</p>
<p>The GPM should be stable from month to month in your reporting.  If it is not, it leads a business owner to the process of asking and answering questions.  Questions like:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li>My materials costs rose this month. Why?</li><li>Our labor costs include a lot of overtime. What happened?</li><li>Is this a permanent condition or is this just something out of the ordinary that will only happen once?</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>This sends you and your team to delve into these questions and find out answers.  You could find out that your materials costs went up because the price of raw materials rose.  You can find out if this is a temporary condition or a semi-permanent condition.  It might be that there was a shortage on wood because one of the processing plants had a fire and couldn’t produce the wood panels that you need to make the cabinets.  It could be that there is a 25% tariff placed on raw materials coming from another country and that you will have to pay more for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Once you find out the underlying reason for the increase in the materials costs, you have a decision to make: <em>do I raise prices to pass along these increased costs to the customer or do I absorb these costs?</em></p>
<p>Delving into increases in your labor costs is a more managerial Q&amp;A for you and your team. If your labor costs are increasing, you would want to find out if it is taking your people more time to produce the products. Some of the questions you would want to ask include:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li>Is all of the equipment they need working properly? If it isn’t why hasn’t it been fixed? When will it be fixed?</li><li>Are all of our people trained properly? If there are new people making the product, what will it take to get them up to speed?</li><li>Did the company get a big rush order? If so, was a rush charge added to the order to cover the increased expenses for the rush order?</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Knowing the reasons behind the cost increase gives you power to make the right decision for your company.  Once you find out the root cause of these issues, then there are decisions for you to make.  Here’s all the right moves:</p>
<p>If your materials costs are climbing and there is a lack of predictability around these increases, you must raise your prices.  Passing along the kinds of costs that continue to nibble away at your margin will help you reduce one side of the COGS equation.</p>
<p>All COGS labor cost increases mean that you have to make management decisions around your labor practices. Knowing why overtime is required will help you decide the right course of action. Some actions around labor costs include:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li>training your people better</li><li>mixing up experienced and less experienced labor to help train your new people while reducing the cost of errors and slowed production that occurs while people are learning</li><li>hiring more people because the workload is too heavy for the current staffing level</li><li>moving to a second shift production might help with managing overtime</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Here’s the powerful lever that the GPM gives you—the lever of decision-making through management practices.  Anything that effects the COGS means that management takes action to improve its internal practices—purchasing practices and production labor practices.  When we see a swing in the GPM, small business owners know that they have to look internally as to what exactly is happening in these two areas.</p>
<h3><strong>How GPM effects “below the line” expenses</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the expenses below the GPM have an open secret&#8211;you can negotiate to lower costs most easily with variable expenses.  With most variable expenses whether it be an email marketing or an insurance company, you can negotiate the price of their services for your business.  If you can’t get the lower costs that you’d like, you can always find another vendor who can operate at a lower price (remember, they may not give you the best service but it will be at a lower price if that’s your primary objective). If cutting expenses is the strategy you want to use to increase your bottom line, negotiating variable costs is often the quickest way to doing this.</p>
<h3><strong>Integrity in the numbers</strong></h3>
<p>Making certain that your data entry in your financial record keeping system (like Quickbooks or other) is an essential activity in your business.  Oftentimes new or unskilled business owners think they’ll be saving money if they do their books themselves.  This couldn’t be further from the truth.  If you haven’t taken an accounting course or a small business finance course that teaches the elements of bookkeeping, do yourself the best favor ever and hire a bookkeeping firm.  Some of the worst mistakes I have seen in business are the ones that novice owners have made with bookkeeping errors.  You’ve heard the saying “garbage in garbage out” well, this is a prime example. If your bookkeeping and record keeping isn’t reliable, it doesn’t do you any good to try to use your numbers for guidance and decision-making.  If you are committed to doing the data entry and numbers yourself, do yourself a favor and take a quick class to learn the rules of the road.  It will pay off exponentially for you. You will be able to generate reliable financial reports and this is the basis to running a good business and being able to trust your data so that you can grow into the powerhouse you know that your business can be.</p>
<h3><strong>Making your GPM your MVP</strong></h3>
<p>Taking what you learned here and turning it into a company practice will cement the habit of using your hard-earned data for decision-making. First thing that must be done: properly collect your data. Collecting your employees digital or physical timecards and inputting this data into your accounting system is key.  Of course, there are many digital companies that have apps to help facilitate this.  The most important part of this is that it gets done.  The best app is meaningless if your staff doesn’t follow the guidelines for data collection.  It’s imperative that your staff participate and understand how important it is for them to give correct data so that reliable reports can be generated.</p>
<p>It is also very important that you track materials costs and stay in touch with your most important or key vendors.  Oftentimes, they will share with you when a price increase is coming so you can anticipate it or find a substitute for the material that is affected by a price increase. Knowing what the cost of your components are from month to month will help you manage your margins.</p>
<p>Every month, your company must close your books.  This means reconciling your outstanding accounts like bank accounts (payroll accounts, operating accounts, credit cards etc….) and running your income statement reports—try for the same day of every month and put it on your calendar.  Turning an idea into a practice is the way to take what we know we aspire to into something we know we can accomplish.</p>
<p>Your income statement is your most accessible tool that shows you your trending results from month to month, quarter to quarter, and year to year.  Your GPM is the guiding light that gives you the information to ask and answer the questions that help you captain your company to playing the game with confidence and easy.  Having the tools, the people and the practices come together makes your company hum.  Who knows, with mastering your GPM, maybe you can be the winner takes all in your industry’s world series.</p>

<h4>Interested to read the full transcript? Here it is!</h4>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Hi. I want to welcome all of you to On Deck&#8217;s Facebook live, featuring the one, the only Ramon Ray.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Hey everybody.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So excited that you&#8217;re here with us. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            You&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 One of the great things about working with small business owners is that they love to learn and love to ask questions, and my favorite part about my role here as the content manager is that I get to help educate business owners, and make sure that all their questions are being answered.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            I love it.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So, I just want to start off by, if you could tell something about how you got to where you are today. I know you got a lot of fans, and we&#8217;re gonna get you some more.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Awesome. Ariele thank you so much. A big thank you to the On Deck team for hosting this. It&#8217;s awesome for me to educate business owner. I am a small business. I have a team of about five, I&#8217;m probably leaving somebody out, but about five, and I love what I do. In essence, I&#8217;ve started four companies. Two I currently run, smallbiztechnology.com, which is a online resource about all things technology in business. Smart hustle magazine, which is a magazine all about the stories of entrepreneurship, maybe people who are customers of On Deck, and we provide content. We educate business owners is the essence of what we do, so think of Inc. Entrepreneurs the great magazines and content sites. That&#8217;s in essence what I do. How do I make my money? I work with large brands and help them better reach small business, and hang out with cool people like Ariele and educate. So in essence what I do. I play piano. I love burnt pancakes, making pancakes, and two glasses of cold milk on Saturday mornings.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 That sounds great. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day as well.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Mine too. Today I had an exception to that, I had more like bagel, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, with orange juice, which is a secondary favorite.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Alright, we&#8217;ll go there. Just to start us off, what is one thing that you could share with the business owners watching today, something that you&#8217;ve just learned along the way that you think every business owner should know.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question, and there&#8217;s so many things we could say Ariele, but I think that for one is to go narrow, narrow, narrow, and I may repeat some of these things depending on how we go along. I&#8217;m just speaking from my heart, so I think really it&#8217;s to go narrow. Sometimes I find as business owners we can say &#8220;you know what? Who is this watch for? Anybody who needs to tell time.&#8221; That&#8217;s not the case. Maybe my buddy Ariele here, this may not be the watch for her, or she may not want to have a watch. She probably wants to keep track of time. So I think the aspect of going niche, Seth Goden, often says that &#8220;don&#8217;t be afraid to go narrow, narrow before you expand.&#8221; If that helps to make sense.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah, I think that&#8217;s great advice. I also think when you&#8217;re starting out a business, or even if you&#8217;re making a change in your business, knowing exactly who you&#8217;re trying to reach is gonna help solve a lot of problems along the way.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Absolutely. When you go too big, I think you find that you can&#8217;t serve everybody. You think you&#8217;re serving everybody, but it&#8217;s too big. You can&#8217;t please everybody, and then you&#8217;re disappointed.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Exactly. So in terms of growing a business, there are so many ways that you can go about it from marketing to sales. When a business owner is trying to make that decision, where do you think is the best place to start?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Sure, and listen I wish I had a case study like a business, right here, we could think &#8220;huh, they&#8217;re a fashion retailer, and they&#8217;re doing, this this&#8221;&#8230; We can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s me and you, so I&#8217;m gonna make up some broad strokes. I think again, you&#8217;ve already started your business now, you got the basics done, LLC or SCORP, you&#8217;ve got your bank account, which is some of you need to do that. But you have that already done. How do you grow? I think a few areas. One, I found in the school of hard knocks, I think, and I only started recently saying this Ariele because I normally would say sales and marketing are the things, which I&#8217;ll touch on. But I think you&#8217;re operations.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            You can&#8217;t grow unless something is systematized that you&#8217;re able, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m working for Ariele&#8217;s sweater company, and if she doesn&#8217;t have an operations procedure, how to do sales for example, I can&#8217;t grow into a new role, if that makes sense. You can&#8217;t hire new people because you&#8217;re always reinventing the wheel. And you can probably help me say this better. But somehow operations, and my point is systems, procedures, best practices, training, so that you&#8217;re running like a machine is what I&#8217;m trying to say. So I think that as you&#8217;re growing, you&#8217;re a pizza shop owner. If there is a certain way that your cashier is supposed to do cashiering, then you need to make sure that you have that written down. So I think that&#8217;s number one thing. Hopefully we&#8217;ll touch on sales and other things, marketing, which I&#8217;ll touch on. But I think if I had to think of one thing for growing companies, man, operations. Get that down pat.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a really interesting insight because a lot of people would go straight into sales or marketing or a combination of the both, but it&#8217;s really hard to do one or both of those things without knowing how you&#8217;re going about doing it.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Exactly.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 But moving on from there, when you&#8217;re talking about sales and marketing, some businesses it&#8217;s easier to do sales, it&#8217;s easier to do marketing, how do you make that decision?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Absolutely, good point. So let&#8217;s talk about both. For me, I find that marketing, that&#8217;s my jam, that&#8217;s my favorite. You can see me just coming alive and yours as well. So I love marketing. I&#8217;m a marketer. I love the aspect of educating customers about how you can help solve their problem. If you&#8217;re Great Adventure you provide fun for kids, educate moms and dads, &#8220;hey, it&#8217;s Saturday, sunny, how can you spend time with your family. By coming to Great Adventure.&#8221; You know? So you&#8217;re educating.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yes.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Sales is more, so I think it&#8217;s important as well, is how do you get people to buy? I think that&#8217;s the sales aspect, meaning two dollars off, 20 percent off. Sales and marketing are similar cousins, but one I think is more of a brand-play educational and one is really we&#8217;re gonna move you along. So I think, listen, both are important. I think it really depends on what you&#8217;re doing in the stage.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Let&#8217;s say you are a food business, maybe a common food business, let&#8217;s go back to pizza. I don&#8217;t know why I like pizza a lot. You probably want to focus on sales. There&#8217;s not too much education you need to do. Are you dreaming of pepperoni tonight? It&#8217;s really get people in the door, have them buy a slice of pizza.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Yeah? That make sense in a small example? Maybe if your a limousine company, maybe doing transportation from Newark airport, Chicago or anywhere in the world. You still need to make a sale, but I think there you could use some more education. Busy,late at night coming home from a party you could take so. Does that make sense? Ariele!</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah! That makes sense to me. I think what to sum it up.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Please</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Correctly, hopefully is know what your business does and you be able to sort out which way is the right way for you to focus.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Exactly absolutely</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So if you struggling to decide can I focus on sales or can I focus on marketing? Which one do I do first? Just get back to the basics and really ask yourself the question what do I do?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Right</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 And then you can move on from there.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            And I think by all things every busy has to have some degree of marketing for sure. Those of you that are stuck in the old school of just sales that&#8217;s good. But I think everybody needs to start a test from some in the marketing. Of course our jam would be social media somewhat is the lowest easiest to do you can start with 25 dollars and 30 dollars and just test. Yeah know? Should I do shave or Afro? Which one do people like more? You can test it and see. Or should I grow my hair out?</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 I think you should grow your hair out. So based on that what you we&#8217;re just bringing up, so for social media you can really do[inaudible 00:07:34] for pretty cheap, with big businesses, corporation like one deck, we have big budgets and its not a struggle to decide do we do this or do that? Its how much of this and how much of that? With small businesses like my husband has a small business and we talk about it all the time. We only have a few hundred dollars a month to spend on marketing. It&#8217;s like how are we spending that few hundred dollars to get the most bang for our buck? Where do you see businesses owners using that money?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Am I allowed to shout out people on here? So shout out to Steven whoever you may be thank you for the thumbs up and thanks for all of you watching and if you have questions we may take them we may not, but thank you the engagement we love seeing it so make me feel great. So I would ask what your question was again but I remember it now. So about deciding how much to spend and how to leverage our social media. Listen I think there&#8217;s a few ways to do it. I think one focus on as ariele said its always good to know what your trying to sell and do. That&#8217;s important! Am I trying to sell this watch sell? Sell a sweater? Or do I want people to just sign up for my need magnet, some of marketers might know that term like a free PDF. Just get them into my funnel and you guys can google these words if your sure what they are we can dive into some of them. So that&#8217;s one, let&#8217;s take something like Instagram and you are a fashion company making amazing orange sweaters let&#8217;s say.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            You may want to do Instagram campaign everything about orange. Orange berets on dogs, orange paint, oranges, you following me? Its a silly example having some fun about all things orange, promoting that, and seeing how can I attract people who who like orange and people who like fashion, now you can start to drive into your funnel and then start to sell them. So that&#8217;s kinda how I see it, but I would say task 2, where&#8217;s your audience at? I happen to not be on snap chat, lets say ariele business with her and her husband they find out most of their audience is on snap chat, you may want to go for it. It just happens to not be where my audience is cause their business owners also[inaudible 00:09:34] so that kinda how I do. One where is your audience at, two test and measure three experiment if you can&#8217;t afford 5 dollars or 15 dollars you~need to reevaluate your business I think. But of your business is any size YOU CAN [inaudible 00:09:48][inaudible 00:09:49]</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah! I think that&#8217;s one of the things, that when talking with a lot of small business owners they&#8217;re so scared to test because they don&#8217;t want to waste money.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Yes!</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 And when all your resources are so precious, that&#8217;s something good say [inaudible 00:10:03] even just testing on Facebook or Instagram, you can test for five dollars, its not a big commitment and you can really learn a lot with very little investment.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Just do it and do it and do it and focus on educating too. Use social media to educate.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Were big fans of education here. So this is [inaudible 00:10:25] really are people who don&#8217;t have a lot of time, we even did a study a couple years back, that just the amount of time it takes business owners to fill out a loan application at the bank. Something like 33 hours and on deck its minutes, and that was something we really connected with us a marketers and as people who run a business ,really connecting the fact that business owners don&#8217;t have time, so when your saying to business owners you have to do this sort of marketing and that sort of marketing and you have to this sale and you have to meet this operations manual. What are some tools that you&#8217;ve used that&#8217;s helpful to us to streamline some of your daily tasks?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            I will tell you the secret step I used for my day today. But you can&#8217;t tell anybody its a secret just us in this room. No. So one when your talking to the smaller business, again as ariele said if you have a larger company with 200, 300 ,400 people, your on different size scale than those of us laid with 1 to 10. But this works for all and especially as an individual, so one I have an administrative assistant now for half of you, they may be like that&#8217;s easy we have staff. For some of you who don&#8217;t who are growing, get help someone just to manage your calender, somebody you&#8217;t don&#8217;t want to do or don&#8217;t have the skill set to do.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            So get help, whether its hiring a team or whatever it is, so for me its an executive assistant. Point two to that point of hiring people I think get a team as your business grows, you may not have time to do cropping folders yourself. There&#8217;s people who can do it better than you and cheaper than you. So get a team together is point two, three i am a fastidious award. Does that mean like focused on? I like to use big words that I don&#8217;t know what they mean. But anyways I am focused laser like on using a few tools.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            So I use a task management tool, the name doesn&#8217;t matter, so the name was net relevant, but I use a task management tool. To organize my day so I forward my emails bcc my emails, my teams assigned task, that&#8217;s point three. I think four delegate that to [inaudible 00:12:35] and I&#8217;m learning that as you may not have a big event coming up 8 November[inaudible 00:12:38] listen I delegate I want to do things like this. I have a team that&#8217;s working right now on the event, so those four things. Yeah delegate, get somebody to admin, use some cool tools, learn to say no as well. I think that&#8217;s a big way to get back time so often, we&#8217;re like yes I&#8217;ll do it, yes I&#8217;ll do it, yes I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            When its okay to say you know ariele no I just cannot. See that&#8217;s kinda mean, say no ariele you smile and say no I can&#8217;t do it today, or I say no, so I think those are a few things to boost productivity cause its a common problem the more time you have the more you can grow your business.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah! I think those are really great pieces of advice and think for business owners that are just starting out the concept of having a team is really, is a scary thing because, having overhead is scary because you have enough to cover every month, and that&#8217;s something those are really relativity simple low cost solutions to getting back a lot of time</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Absolutely</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So, one of my favorite questions to ask people is. What are some of the key mistakes or one key mistake you made along the way that you think with would be helpful to share with business owners?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            [inaudible 00:13:56] I&#8217;ve made a lot, I think the glamour of social media gives this image which is nice sometimes, you know[inaudible 00:14:03][inaudible 00:14:04][inaudible 00:14:04] and I&#8217;m blessed I&#8217;ve had some success and you&#8217;ve had some success but this has been a journey, so I always like to say that because I think the[inaudible 00:14:12] watching on video and social media its like ooo well there a lot that&#8217;s not like oo</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Absolutely</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            But the success I have had I think of some mistakes I&#8217;ve made and one of the biggest ones and I can give an example where the result is not plan ahead now there&#8217;s many mistakes that can happen but for me I happen to be a shoot first ask questions later or a fire then aim person and that&#8217;s been the biggest mistake for my business. I&#8217;m going to tell you what happened, ill tell you what happened, don&#8217;t laugh at me. You guys cannot be laughing at me right now okay!just keep the serious face. I do conferences one of the things I do I have my event and things like this. So I said you know what I&#8217;ve done ten events five to 80 events whatever it was in the new york area, I can do an event in San Francisco, because I&#8217;m Ramon ray. So I booked a hotel or venue or something, got the cheap food and the signage, you know because, not a lot of people came</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 What?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Same thing I said why not?</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So no one came to see you?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            No!</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 I&#8217;d fly across the country to see you!</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Thank you ariele! But the point being is that I didn&#8217;t think through it. I didn&#8217;t plan, I can go on to details. But I think that&#8217;s the best for me is planning, being thoughtful, and taking small baby steps, maybe I should&#8217;ve had a meet up group and a greeter space or something and had ten people and testing it. Before I hade the 5000 person event. So I think for me its not thinking ahead, and I would say also and not just since we&#8217;re on decks house here, would be a student manager of your money, be financially illiterate and that&#8217;s kind of another thing I would say, is a whole another conversation with you guys[inaudible 00:15:51]</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Its a conversation we can have another time and we will we talk about it all the time.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            But for me that&#8217;s a mistake since I haven&#8217;t done it, that&#8217;s one thing I ding myself Ramon be more financially aware so.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah I think being aware, someone once said as a business owner if you don&#8217;t know the number in your business bank account off the top of your head, your doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            That is so true.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 And I can tell you it&#8217;s the funniest discussion I have when I get home with my husbands business, hey I have this much money in my business checking account. I didn&#8217;t need to know that but okay thank you. Its just so on his mind all the time and as business owners the finances should be on your mind all the time and you can start to delegate out the other things. But really you can have an accountant, have a book keeper, but you need to know what their doing. SO that if they&#8217;re making a mistake or if something is not right you know that you can stop it before its gets.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            So true. So true. Yeah if you don&#8217;t know, you can&#8217;t blame somebody else, oh my accountant it was her folder, they clicked the wrong button on whatever software their using.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah!</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            It falls on you. Let me do that again. It falls on you.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So were starting to wrap up here at our Facebook live and we&#8217;ve so enjoyed having all of you with us today! Just Ramon is there any last thought or piece of inspiration you could share with business owners out there?</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Sure yeah! I mean a few things. I think one if its okay can I invite people to my 8 November?</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yeah!</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Okay good.good to hear. So 8 November I have big event coming up! A smart hustle small business conference and you can just check it out at smarthustle.com/conference. Seth golden will be there and many other speakers, so come and if your type in On deck, capital on deck, in the little discount code event system that I have, you&#8217;ll get a nice discount. So please come.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 Yes!</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            But a few last minute things. I mean I think one have fun, that&#8217;s the least for me if I can&#8217;t have fun in my business we&#8217;ve taken the struggle to have our own business in the hustle, have fun. I think two always be learning and be curious for me there&#8217;s a lot that I know personal brandy and things kinda my jam I can always learn but going back to finances I go to conferences and events so I can learn because its a weak area, so always be learning. I think three the power of networking and getting out of your comfort zone. Like today, I&#8217;ve known ariele for awhile she&#8217;s know me for awhile lets do something together and try it and say hello. I think being able to do that you never know where things can lead and what happens.</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            So have fun learn, get out of your comfort zone, and do Facebook lives.</p>
<p>Ariele Krantzow:                 So I want to thank all of you for coming and joining us today, well ill be sharing this later,, so if you missed part of it or you missed the beginning don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;ll have it up there. I want to thank Ramon so much for coming and for all of you look and talking about education. You can go to ondeck.com/resources we have a ton of articles specifically about business financing, about just finance and budgeting in general and marketing and sales and tons of other topics that I think you&#8217;ll find really helpful. So we look forward to seeing you on future Facebook live and we&#8217;ll see you next time. Bye!</p>
<p>Ramon Ray:                            Bye!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gross Revenue Vs. Net Revenue Explained:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simply put your </span><b>gross revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is your earnings </span><b><i>before</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> you deduct your expenses and your </span><b>net revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is your earnings </span><b><i>after</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> you subtract your expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding the difference between your gross revenue and your net revenue will tell you how successful you are at controlling your expenses&#8230; and generating profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s important to understand all the costs associated with doing business, including the cost of goods sold, the lease on where you do business, employee payroll, and even incidental expenses like paper supplies or your utility bill.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is this difference important?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Often investors will be more interested in your gross revenue because it shows your businesses ability to generate sales and potential for growth. If your business opened a new location gross revenue can be a far more useful metric than net revenue because it indicates potential, without the clouded judgement of the one time cost of opening that new location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This does not mean you can afford to discount the importance of net revenue (your actual profits). This is the best way for you, as a business owner, to make decisions of cost and worth. Even if a product or service is bringing in a lot of revenue, you can see after deducting all the expenses associated with that product, whether or not  it is a profitable product or service for your business. Often you will be able see where you can and can not cut costs to make your business more efficient—and where you have greater profit-generating opportunities. </span></p>
<p><b>How is this relevant to business financing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most lenders, from your local bank to the SBA to online lenders like OnDeck, look at Gross Revenue as a minimum qualification requirement. This means, like most investors they want to know what you potential for bringing in capital to your business. This helps lenders determine how much money is appropriate to lend to a particular business while using your</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/build-a-strong-business-credit-profile"> <span style="font-weight: 400">business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/why-is-your-personal-credit-score-part-of-a-business-loan-decision"> <span style="font-weight: 400">personal credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/cash-flow-business-owners-know"> <span style="font-weight: 400">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to determine your ability to pay the loan back. You’ll want to make sure you understand your net revenue to determine how easily or difficult it will be to service the debt.</span></p>
<p>I hope this help you understand the differences between gross revenue vs. net revenue.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With only four months left in the year, many business owners are looking for ways to finish strong to make sure they end the year on the profitable side of the balance sheet. Over the course of the nearly 40 years of my career, I’ve learned that Benjamin Franklin was right, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” In other words, there are profits to be captured by making your business work more efficiently—or you might be able to consider the idea that efficiency is strength.</p>
<p>As a leader, finding ways to streamline processes, remove roadblocks, and facilitate your employee’s abilities to do their jobs makes them more efficient; and your business more profitable.</p>
<p>For example, early in my career I worked in my father’s industrial supply business. He sold bolts, nuts, and other hardware to manufacturers and industrial construction companies. On an almost daily basis, we would often cut bar stock to size for our customers, sometimes several hundred cuts at a time. In the early days, we used an abrasive wheel and a chop saw (a time-consuming and dirty job). It wasn’t very efficient and nobody liked the job, so we all avoided it as much as we could—which wasn’t very productive.</p>
<p>Although the chop saw seemed like a cheap way to get the job done, the day we bought a large band saw we could adjust to cut the material to the right size and automatically feed the stock to be cut, was a day for celebration. Now, instead of standing at the chop saw, we could start the job, the saw would feed the stock to the proper size, and all we had to do was keep it filled with material to cut. Not only that, we didn’t have to breath the dust from the abrasive wheel, we stopped avoiding those jobs, and we could do other things while the band saw did its job. It made things a lot more efficient.</p>
<p>The band saw made things so much easier, it was hard to imagine why we went so long with the old chop saw.</p>
<h3><strong>Big Results Through Small and Incremental Efficiency Efforts</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time, it doesn’t require, what we felt like was a big change, (like the band saw) to generate efficiencies that have a big impact. Most of the time, small, incremental, and sometimes very minor efforts can yield very big results.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m a big proponent of in-service training programs that leverage employee’s experiences and expertise that can help everyone be more efficient. In my current role, I spend a lot of time behind a personal computer; something that didn’t even exist when I started my career. This kind of sounds ridiculous as I write it, but I remember how difficult it was to learn how to use something as simple as a program like Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint when they first came out—now I don’t think I could do my job without them.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve learned numerous shortcuts that make me much more efficient in how I use the software. Some of those shortcuts I figured out on my own (a very inefficient way to do it), but most were shared with me by people who already knew. My more experienced colleagues were a great source of information that helped me be better at whatever my job was at the time. And, because we were sharing information, I had noticed and picked up a skill or two that benefitted them.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are three things, that might appear small and insignificant, that you can do to help your employees be more efficient, your business more profitable, and end your year strong:</p>

			<ol><li><strong>Look at your office, your shop, or your workspace:</strong> Sometimes something as simple as changing the way desks fit together, or the way tool boxes are situated, or the way the work space is generally set up can make a difference. For example, we had everything we needed to weigh, count, measure, and box materials for shipment all in the same place and all together so preparing an order for shipment was easier. This part of the warehouse was also near the door, so it was easier to get it on the truck when it came to pick up. What can you do in your business to make the workspace more efficient?</li><li><strong>Make sure your employees have the right tools: </strong>I admit I am somewhat of a tool nerd. I’ve found, as an amateur and self-taught motorcycle mechanic, that having the right tool for the job makes it a lot easier and faster to get the job done. Do your employees have the tools they need to be efficient? It could be something as simple as a more robust Internet connection if your business is online or a well-stocked closet of office supplies—or maybe even that specialty tool for compressing the spring on a motorcycle clutch.</li><li><strong>Do you encourage and reward employees for finding ways to improve what they’re doing?</strong> I’m convinced that those closest to the work tend to understand it the best. As a result, during the course of the day they often notice things that would make their jobs easier and more efficient. If you have an employee or two who have the same suggestion, it could be worth considering make a change (if needed). What’s more, offering a reward to employees who bring forward ideas that can help your business be more efficient and profitable—or even stronger, is an even better idea.</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>Looking over the list, these are things you may have even heard before, but in the spirit of small things that can have a big potential impact, don’t ignore them because you’ve heard them before. See if there are ways to make small and incremental improvements in how you do business that will make your business more efficient and more profitable.</p>
