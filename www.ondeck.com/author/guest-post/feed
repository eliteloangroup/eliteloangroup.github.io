			<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Article Summary<br /></strong>Social media can be a great tool for your small business.

<p>Your business knows social media is important, but where do you begin? Digital advertising revenue, driven by networks like Facebook, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/03/advertising-trends-2017.html">expected to increase 18 percent</a> year over year to reach $229 billion this year. Social is where the people are, where they’re consuming media, where they’re interacting with friends and getting recommendations, where they’re looking to discover new brands and products that fit their needs, and so much more.</p>
<p>Where your business spends its time and money can get out of hand without strategy. Here are some ideas for how to focus your efforts on the right networks, using the right tools, to save your business money and improve return on investment.</p>
<h4>Use Built-In Network Applications</h4>
<p>Even if your small business doesn’t have the budget to work with an agency on social media or hire someone full-time in-house to handle it, the good news is that networks are free and most have built-in reporting tools to provide you with insights. Some, like Facebook, even offer scheduling features.</p>
<p>When it comes to the social media networks your business should be on, here’s a look at some you might consider:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>Facebook: </strong>The big daddy of social networks, the site has 1.94 billion monthly users, with more than 68 percent of adults using it. Considering its large market share, Facebook should be the number one priority for B2C businesses to have a presence on. You can share photos, videos, text updates, slideshows and more, and schedule posts ahead of time within the Facebook app. The site has rich reporting features built into every business page profile, including info on when your users are on the site and how many people interact with each post.</li><li><strong>Twitter: </strong>Twitter has 328 million monthly users, which may seem to pale in comparison to Facebook, but it’s important to realize some of the most important people to your brand are often avid users on the network: journalists, bloggers and influencers. The platform gives brands the capability, unlike Facebook, to directly message any user who follows the brand page. This makes it easier for your business to build relationships with influential users and get more press. The network also has a free analytics tool that shows top Tweets and followers.</li><li><strong>Instagram: </strong>Powered by Facebook, Instagram is key for any visually-minded brand like a restaurant or clothing store. With 700 million monthly active users, businesses that can shine visually through photos or videos should have an Instagram. An Instagram account is essential to brands in verticals like fashion, hospitality, food and beverage, and art, but any business can use the network to show off company culture or re-share posts from followers to engage with consumers. Instagram business users get a free insights tool that shows follower demographics, follower growth and impressions.</li><li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> Pinterest has 150 million users, and like Instagram, it’s a great way for visual brands to get noticed through "pinning" images on vision board-like displays. The network skews heavily female, with <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent of online American women</a> using the network compared with 17 percent of males, so if your brand targets women, you might consider setting up a profile here. Brands with a free business account get free analytics on Pinterest, showing top posts, audience details and stats about your profile.</li><li><strong>YouTube: </strong>Not everyone uses YouTube in a social sense, but with 1.5 billion monthly users, the power of the channel can’t be ignored. If you plan to produce videos, YouTube is key, because you also get the added benefit of keyword-optimized videos showing up in Google search results, the network that owns YouTube. You can also interact with user comments, comment on other videos to connect with more users and add other videos to your own page to build up content if you don’t produce your own. You can schedule videos in advance through YouTube, and YouTube’s analytics provide insight into demographics, traffic sources and watch time.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>A few other social networks your business might consider include:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong>A haven for B2B enterprises, LinkedIn is still a good place for B2C brands to have a presence because there are more than 500 million users on the network. You can post business updates, encourage your staff to grow their personal brands by interacting in LinkedIn Groups, and use free LinkedIn analytics to gauge what type of content works best for your business on the network.</li><li><strong>Snapchat:</strong> If your B2C targets teenagers and millennials, you should consider Snapchat. More than 60 percent of American smartphone users ages 13 to 34 use the social network, which has 161 million users. Photo and video content does well here, which “self-destructs” from the app after 24 hours, making it a great place to share special offers.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Now that you have a better idea of what networks you could be on, here’s how to use these networks to boost revenue.</p>
<h4>Get Organized to Align Social with Sales</h4>
<p>Top brands save time and money by aligning marketing strategy with sales efforts. It seems like a no-brainer to tap into sales objectives and campaigns to power marketing, yet some brands lack a social strategy and then wonder why they’re not getting results.</p>
<p>A content calendar can help streamline your efforts. Agora Pulse and other similar tools, offer a free editorial calendar template. You can map out your entire business year with your sales team in the room. Discuss product launch dates, plans for holiday specials and seasonal trends where certain products should be spotlighted. Use the calendar as a guide to plan your social content, but be flexible enough to adjust content by checking in with sales on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>One brand that boosted its sales initiatives with social is a company I worked with as a consultant a few years ago. They were a local nursery trying to compete with much bigger big box store competitors. They had been in business for many years and had amassed a very complete catalog of advice they shared in article form with customers who visited their store. When I advocated sharing the advice on social media with an offer to meet with a gardening expert who could help them with their particular landscaping or gardening questions, they were not only skeptical, but they though they would be giving away what set them apart from the big box—real, honest to goodness, expertise.</p>
<p>They decided to give it a try. For the next three months we promoted this advice via their blog and their Facebook page. We included an invitation to come into the store and visit with one of the gardening experts about their yard or their garden. The education content shared on social media was so successful, they had to make managing that effort a full-time job for one of their employees—they had that many people visiting the store with questions and ultimately becoming customers.</p>
<p>They have since expanded this effort on Instagram with beautiful images of flowers and garden plants with tips for planting season and other useful information.</p>
<h4>Automate Social Media Posts</h4>
<p>Instead of your social media manager, or whoever’s in charge of social at your startup, having to manually log in to every single social network to post, schedule them all at once in one tool. This way, if you want to have an editor or second pair of eyes view them, they can do this all at once.</p>
<p>Here are three social media automation tools you might consider:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>Agora Pulse: </strong>AP is a great tool that we use here at OnDeck. We love it because it’s such a simple, intuitive platform. You can use it to easily schedule posts for all of your social channels and listen to conversations happening around your business or industry. Their measurement tools are straightforward. Most importantly for a small business owner, you do not need to be a social media maven to utilize this product.</li><li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Similar to Agora Pulse, this social scheduling platform allows multiple users to access various channels and messages within one platform. Besides the scheduling, Buffer has stellar analytics that track engagement, impressions and account performance. The free platform allows two profiles and 10 scheduled posts per profile, while paid accounts increase the more users and platforms there are.</li><li><strong>CoSchedule: </strong>In addition to offering a social media scheduling tool, CoSchedule enables article scheduling and blog post management, plus scheduling for marketing projects. It provides more transparency into the various arms of a marketing department, to help you align your strategy. Plans with social scheduling start at $40 per month.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Using fewer tools for scheduling and reporting saves more of your team time. But how do you know what to pay for?</p>
<h4>Social Media Shopping Tips</h4>
<p>The great news is, all of the tools mentioned above, and many more, offer free trials so startups can see what works best for their team and business needs. Take advantage of these trials by having your employees test them out. Pepper customer service members of each tool with questions as they come up, so you can see how responsive they’ll be when you have problems in the future and how much help they can offer. Before you start the trials, come up with metrics you’ll use to measure just how much time your team is saving, through ease of use and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Ask your staff to reach out to their personal contacts or use forums like LinkedIn Groups to ask others in your industry what they’d recommend. Make social media tools a topic of conversation at your next industry networking event.</p>
<p>You can also request a consultation with each tool’s sales team, so you can explain exactly what you need and see what they offer you. Signing up for a tool can bring it significant revenue over time, and they want your business. Don’t be afraid to let each one know what you want, and have them get to work to show you how they&#8217;ll make the tool work for you.</p>
<p>Continue to ask for input from your team members who end up using the tools once you&#8217;ve signed up, so you can switch services if something is not working. As people get used to working with a tool, they may come to accept frustrations that could be costing you money, so regular check-ins can help keep your team — and your wallet — happy.</p>

<p>Like many business owners, it&#8217;s likely you are constantly seeking ways to save money on operating expenses, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/create-plan-managing-employee-expenses-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including payroll</a>. One area where many employers target is paid time off. It is a truism that providing paid time off, especially paid sick leave, is costly. While this may be an understandable approach, denying paid sick leave for your workers is a penny wise, but pound foolish policy that will likely cost your business money in the end. What&#8217;s more, providing paid sick leave for your workers benefits your company’s bottom line in ways you might not realize.</p>
<h3>Less Absenteeism</h3>
<p>The flu season of 2017 and 2018 was one of the worst in recent history. A particularly severe strain of the flu (H3N2) reduced the effectiveness of the flu vaccine; that and widespread infection (46 states as of January 2018) combined to create nearly a perfect storm. Another factor that almost certainly made matters worse was a unavailability of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 28 percent of all civilian workers — approximately 45 million Americans — do not have access to paid sick leave. If they take time off from work, their paychecks suffer. They may even risk losing their jobs. The result is a phenomenon known as “presenteeism” — people reporting for work who should be home in bed, or even in the hospital. It is a widespread occurrence. According to a July 2016 report co-produced by NPR, The Robert Wood Foundation and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, every week 1.5 million Americans who do not have paid sick leave go to work when they are sick.</p>
<p>In a confined environment like an office, a single sick employee can infect an entire staff, with some becoming so ill that they cannot come to work. Multiply this occurrence by thousands of sick people riding public transportation, interacting in public places and working in food-handling or health care environments. It doesn’t take much effort to comprehend how an epidemic can reach potentially debilitating proportions. On the other hand, providing paid sick leave — and encouraging workers to use it — not only allows sick workers to recuperate, it also reduces the risk of your other employees missing time due to illness.</p>
<h3>Better Morale</h3>
<p>Many employers resist efforts to raise minimum wages and impose paid sick leave, but often change their minds once such policies have been put in place. The reason is simple: their fears of employee abuse and escalating costs have largely proven to be unfounded. For example, San Francisco has mandated paid sick leave since 2007. However, the median worker only takes 3 of 5 allowed sick days each year, and 6 out of 7 employers reported no significant detrimental effect on profitability.</p>
<p>At the same time, morale among workers increases significantly in workplaces with employee friendly policies such as paid sick leave. About 30 percent of employers in Connecticut reported improved morale among their employees as a result of the passage of a paid sick leave law.</p>
<h3>Reduced Employee Turnover</h3>
<p>At the height of the Great Recession, there were more than 6 applicants for every job opening. In that environment, employers felt free to demand more productivity from their employees while holding down wages and cutting back on perks like paid sick leave.</p>
<p>However, by 2013 the ratio had fallen to 2.9 job seekers to every opening and has continued to fall. In the resulting tight labor market, employees are naturally more likely to seek better working conditions, and employers have begun to respond accordingly, including those in the traditionally low-paid service sector. For instance, in January 2018, Starbucks announced that it would provide paid sick leave for all its salaried and hourly employees in the interests of improving working conditions and reducing employee turnover.</p>
<h3>Increased Productivity</h3>
<p>Sick workers are less productive than healthy workers. It may seem obvious, but many employers fail to realize the financial benefit they stand to gain from adopting a paid sick leave policy. According to a study cited by the New York Times, lower productivity from sick workers on the job costs employers as much as their medical care. In other words, employers aren’t saving any money by encouraging (or demanding) their workers to report to work when they’re sick. On the other hand, providing paid sick leave for your workers not only means less “presenteeism” but also allows workers to address acute conditions such as dental problems while they are relatively minor.</p>
<h3>Lower Risk to Your Customers or Clients</h3>
<p>Companies with employees in public-facing jobs or businesses affiliated with the medical or food industries especially stand to benefit from providing their workers paid sick leave. Workers in these situations who feel compelled to come to work while they are sick may spread infectious diseases that are not only detrimental to their colleagues but also place the general public at risk.</p>
<p>Providing paid sick leave is not just a “nice” benefit for employers to provide for their workers. It’s also smart business policy. Morale, productivity and the bottom line all benefit when workers are allowed to stay home when they are not feeling well, without risking their jobs.</p>

			<p><b>Article Summary:</b> Preparing for your busy season is much easier today than it once was.

<p>In many respects, a busy season is a healthy development. It’s a signal that your company is generating abundant revenues. Busy seasons may also signal a payoff for the hard work associated with establishing a business and getting the word out to prospective clients and customers. However, maximizing the benefits from a busy season requires more than providing services and products in real time. Anticipation and analysis are each essential to ensure that your company is prepared to properly handle busy seasons.</p>
<h4><b>Incorporate Predictive Analytics to Anticipate Demand</b></h4>
<p>Back in the day, attempting to anticipate demand involved more guesswork than anything else. At best, companies estimated their future inventory or service needs based on the outcome of previous seasons or accounting periods, coupled with applicable forecasts — such as anticipated severe weather or a rise in unemployment rates.</p>
<p>However, thanks to better data availability along with advances in hardware and software to analyze the data, guesswork has been largely replaced by systematic, estimation known as predictive analytics. Predictive analysis harnesses the information contained within historical data to anticipate future outcomes. No longer the exclusive domain of mathematicians and statisticians, predictive analytics has migrated into the mainstream of business operations. Companies that fail to incorporate predictive analytics into their business operations run the risk of being left behind by their competitors.</p>
<p>Along with minimizing fraud risk and evaluating customer creditworthiness, predictive analytics also represents a powerful tool for inventory management. Predictive analysis also improves the effectiveness of marketing campaigns through analyzing customer purchases. Identifying, cultivating and retaining the potentially most lucrative clients or customers is another excellent use of predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/blog/information-technology/top-predictive-analytics-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 predictive analytics tools</a> to help start your search for the tools that could be right for your small business.</p>
<h4><b>Review Company Past Performance</b></h4>
<p>Of course, the best predictive analysis system is only as good as its data. It is not enough to collect basic sales numbers. A proper review of your <a href="http://www.infoentrepreneurs.org/en/guides/review-your-business-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company’s past performance</a> can address many questions, some of the most important of which are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the company effectively reaching its core customers? If not, should there be a reconsideration of the company’s marketing techniques — or its core customers?</li>
<li>How did the company perform in comparison to comparable competitors? Are companies of similar available capacity in products and/or services even busier during busy seasons? If so, how do they accommodate increased demand?</li>
<li>Has the busy season generated a potential for customers who will return during subsequent busy seasons or even during slow season?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Did the company adequately meet its customers’ needs and/or desires during the busy season? Selling out of a hot item is not a positive outcome if too many customers walk away from an establishment empty handed.</li>
<li>Was the busy season evenly distributed among products or services? If not, which products or services lagged?</li>
<li>Was your staff or team up to the task of handling the busy season? If not, was the problem due to inadequate staff numbers, poorly trained staff or staff whose qualifications were simply not up to the task?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers to these and related questions form the foundation of an solid Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis the data from a well-executed SWOT analysis along with predictive analytics provides an excellent basis for analyzing a past busy season as well as preparing for upcoming busy seasons.</p>
<h4><b>Utilize Business Loans and Financing to Fund Essential Investments</b></h4>
<p>One possible outcome from a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/swot-analysis-tools-can-help-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWOT analysis</a> and predictive analytics report is that additional investment is needed to finance essential equipment, inventory or personnel. Especially in very competitive markets or industry sectors, failure to keep up with current equipment and inventory, software or marketing techniques can result in a company being labeled as unresponsive, out-of-touch or outdated.</p>
<p>However, financing essential investments can be challenging. Unless your company is flush with cash, borrowing is called for. There are a number of options for business borrowing, and no one-size-fits-all solution. In fact, depending on size, industry or other factors, companies may need to consider a combination of options to obtain necessary funds from borrowing. A few of the <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/07/how-to-finance-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more common options</a> for small and medium-sized companies are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bank and Credit Union Loans &#8211;</b> Although the financial crisis has yielded to an ongoing recovery, banks have retained stringent standards for granting loans, especially to startups, entrepreneurs or small businesses. Companies with business plans have the best chance of securing bank loans, especially from community banks. Credit unions may also be more lenient, especially with long-time customers.</li>
<li><b>Small Business Administration (SBA) &#8211;</b> <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/sba-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA loans</a> carry federal guarantees, which make it easier for businesses to qualify. However, a solid business plan is still necessary.</li>
<li><b>Invoice Factoring &#8211;</b> For companies that process payments through invoicing, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/need-know-invoice-factoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factoring</a> represents one of the most readily available forms of funding. With invoice factoring, companies yield a percentage of their paid invoice to the invoice factoring provider.</li>

<li><b>Micro Loans &#8211;</b> Credit challenged business borrowers can often obtain small loans (under $35,000) from <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/what-are-micro-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonprofit micro lenders</a>. Formerly associated with enterprises in the developing world, micro-loans are increasingly available in the United States.</li>
<li><b>Crowdfunding &#8211;</b> Crowdfunding isn’t limited to the greatest new gadget or aspiring artist attempting to fund an album. Small companies and startups also turn to crowdfunding. However, many crowdfunding campaigns fall short of their goals.</li>
<li><b>Online Lenders –</b> Many <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/online-applications-small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online lenders</a>, like OnDeck, offer loans for a variety of loan purposes and regularly work with small business owners to fuel growth opportunities or fund other business initiatives. Applications are usually very simple and business borrowers can have an answer that same day and potentially the funds to work with within 24-48 hours.</li>

<p>The key to maximizing the benefits of a busy season is through proactive planning rather than reactive regrouping. Using tools such as predictive analytics, SWOT and judicious financial investments can ensure that your company is ready not only to meet the demand of a busy season, but to reap maximum profits now and in the future.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> This guide aims to inform small business owners on what they should be looking for in a new business credit card. Before diving into the subject of choosing the right business credit card, keep the following in mind: <strong>credit cards are serious financial tools and should be treated as such</strong>. Small business credit cards should be utilized with discipline and with responsibility. This means paying off balances both on time and in full by your card’s due date. By doing so, business credit cards can help you build excellent business credit and save money long term.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>What is a Business Credit Card?</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Business credit cards are designed to assist in funding and providing services for small-to-medium sized businesses. They provide  businesses with multiple advantages, depending on the specific card. These advantages can include:</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Higher credit limits</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> than personal credit cards</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Easier </span><b>separation of personal and business expenses</b></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Rewards</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> such as points and cash back on business expenses</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Benefits</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> such as purchase protection, extended warranties and merchandise discounts</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ability to </span><b>manage a business’ cash flow</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, giving 20-30 days to pay business expenses without interest</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Travel related perks</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> such as travel credits, travel insurance, free hotel stays and elite member status with certain hotels and airlines.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Increased business credit scores.</b></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><b>An overall positive impact on businesses, <span style="font-weight: 400">in areas such as growth in revenue and employment</span>.</b></li></ul>		</div>
		
<h3><b><i>What are the Differences Between Personal and Business Credit Cards?</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are a number of differences between business and personal credit cards that should be noted.</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Business credit cards are not covered by the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Credit CARD Act 2009</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, some card providers still include these protections on their business credit cards. Make sure to check card terms and conditions with providers to find out.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The card applicant will generally be held completely liable for the credit account. Most business credit cards require a personal guarantee, which will hold the card applicant responsible to repay any debt incurred on the card. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Business credit cards are not generally reported on personal credit reports, as long as they are paid in a timely fashion. However, if your credit account goes into negative status, it could show up on your personal credit report.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Business credit scores and personal credit scores are two separate things. Using a business credit card responsibly will help you </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-business-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">build your business credit scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It should be acknowledged that your business does not have one business credit score, but multiple scores. The three main business credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet) all have their own independent methods of calculating their own unique business scores that make up your credit profile.</span></li></ul>		</div>
		
<h3><b><i>As a Business Owner, Why Should I get a Business Credit Card? Why shouldn’t I use my Personal Credit Card?</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a simple answer to this question: separation of personal and business expenses. Utilizing a business credit card for business expenses will help you better track your business costs. Therefore a business credit card assists you in record keeping, filing taxes and claiming business-related tax breaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting business expenses on a personal card is also potentially dangerous. Personal credit cards often have significantly lower credit limits than that of business credit cards. Therefore, using your personal credit card for a large number of business expenses can easily chip into your personal credit limit, or even max it out. Maxing out your personal credit card can cause your personal credit scores to drop. Any problems that occur to your business could then take a huge toll on your personal credit reports, making it difficult to get credit for personal purchases such as a car or home.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>What should I look for in a Business Card?</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The characteristics of a great business credit card are subjective and likely depend on your business. However, note that not all business credit cards are created equal. There are general things to keep in mind when considering the right business credit card for you and your business.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><b>Is it good value in terms of its annual fee? - </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If a business credit card has an annual fee, make sure the received benefits outweigh the yearly cost. A prime example of this is the American Express Business Platinum Card. While the Business Platinum Card comes with a vast suite of rewards and benefits, it also comes with a hefty annual fee of $450. Depending on your type of business, an annual fee such as this may or may not be worth it.<br /><br /></span></li><li><b>How large is the signup bonus? - <span style="font-weight: 400">Businesses usually have higher expenditure than the average consumer, therefore the business credit card sign up bonus should reflect this.</span></b></li></ul><ul><li><strong>What are the rewards for my business expenses?</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400">- The best business credit cards will offer cash back or points for your most frequent types of purchases.</span></li></ul><ul><li><strong>What are the benefits and perks?</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400">- Make sure to check and compare different business credit card rewards and perks. Different cards will suit different businesses. For example, a card that offers numerous travel related perks will offer the most value to a business owner that is required to travel frequently.</span></li></ul><ul><li><strong>How is the card provider’s customer support?</strong> - <span style="font-weight: 400">A card provider known for great customer service can make things easier for business owners in the long term. Don’t let something as simple as bad customer support take a negative toll on your business.</span></li></ul>		</div>
		
<h3><em><b>Conclusion</b></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no one-size-fits all option when it comes to choosing the right business credit card. It’s recommended that business owners research what business credit card rewards and benefits best suit their businesses. Be informed before diving in to a decision: do your research on multiple cards, compare card benefits and terms, and tailor your choice to your business’ aims. But most of all, act responsibly. Like personal credit cards, business credit cards are serious financial tools. They can offer great benefits, save you cash and help you build business credit, but only if used in an informed and responsible manner.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here you are, coffee in hand, ready to tackle your store’s to-do list. But before you know it, you’re dealing with an order that came in unexpectedly, recounting last night’s cash report because it doesn’t add up and covering for your cashier whose, once again, late. Sound familiar? That’s because, on average, business owners spend 68% of their time taking care of day-to-day tasks rather than working “on their business” and <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/smart-business-growth-strategies">preparing it for growth</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, your business is your passion and your life. Except, working more doesn’t <em>always</em> equate to working better. Maybe you’re trying to save costs or you’re worried about delegating jobs to people who won’t execute them as well as you think you would. But the truth is this approach is unsustainable and it’s probably making you waste time. If you don’t recall the last time you felt up to date in your daily tasks, chances are you need to <a target="_blank" href="https://en-ca.ondeck.com/blog/33-productivity-tips-for-small-business-owners/">rethink the way you work</a>. We’ve all wished there were more hours in a day…but that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon. Instead, here are some tips on how to optimize your working method, and gain more free time in the process.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169789" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fist-pump2.jpg?resize=975%2C665&#038;ssl=1" alt="Unexpected Ways Business Owners Can Save Time | OnDeck" width="975" height="665" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fist-pump2.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fist-pump2.jpg?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fist-pump2.jpg?resize=768%2C524&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a;">Mistake: </span><strong>Not trusting your employees enough</strong></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;">Solution: </span><strong>Investing in your team</strong></h2>
<p>You worked hard to get your business off the ground. This is your passion, and you’re right to be protective over what you’ve built. However, there’s a fine line between being selective about who will help you manage your business, and refusing any help at all. You should view the recruitment process like an opportunity to build a strong team and acquire more resources. Read these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/2017/08/build-dream-team-retail-store/">tips on hiring the best employees </a>for a good place to start. When you meet a potential employee, take the time to discuss your business’ core values and get them excited about the possibility of growing into their role. Take interest in candidate’s other interests and skills, and think about how this can benefit your store.</p>
<p>Your employee’s official title may be “sales associate” but if they happen to be talented with social media or if they study graphic design on the side, why shouldn’t you tap into their potential? It’s a win-win situation. Your staff will feel that their work is appreciated, which will likely motivate them to take more initiative and improve their performance in all aspects of the job. As for you, you’ll save time on tasks outside your area of expertise and you’ll be freer to focus on what you do best. Even better? Employees who feel appreciated have a lower rate of absenteeism and contribute to a more positive working environment.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a;">Mistake: </span><strong>Sticking to traditional methods</strong></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;">Solution: </span><strong>Get the right <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/pos/retail/">POS System</a></strong></h2>
<p>Running a business without the proper POS system is like running a marathon without running shoes. It’s possible, but unnecessarily difficult. <span class="s1">Jokes aside, if you haven’t moved on from the<b> </b>old pen and paper method, chances are your competitors have – and that they’re running their business more efficiently. </span>But using a point of sale is not everything, retailers should take the time to consider what system will be the best fit for their type of business. Start by asking yourself what your ideal work day would be like. You probably wish you were spending more time with customers, providing your staff with robust training or developing new marketing strategies. Instead, tasks like inventory management, purchase orders and handling online sales take up large parts of your workday.</p>
<p>Check out these six tips on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/2016/12/to-look-for-when-buying-pos/">picking out the right POS for your business</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/2016/12/to-look-for-when-buying-pos/"> to</a> help guide your decision. Beyond enabling transactions and payments, point of sale technologies provide built-in data reports, marketing tools, and inventory organization. Some POS solutions even offer integrated email marketing tools and customer profiles. <span class="s1">In addition to saving you precious time by automating many of your daily tasks, the right POS can act as a powerful business tool. </span>While switching to a new point of sale solution may seem like a big leap, sticking to a system that doesn’t fulfill your needs is expensive and counterproductive. Your POS can become your strongest ally, so pick wisely! Learn how <a target="_blank" href="https://en-ca.ondeck.com/blog/3-ways-technology-can-help-small-business-owner/">technology and automation tools</a> can save you time and boost your productivity.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169790" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/to-do-list2.jpg?resize=975%2C648&#038;ssl=1" alt="Unexpected Ways Business Owners Can Save Time | OnDeck" width="975" height="648" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/to-do-list2.jpg?w=975&amp;ssl=1 975w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/to-do-list2.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/to-do-list2.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a;">Mistake: </span><strong>Taking on too much</strong></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff;">Solution: </span><strong>Master your to-do list</strong></h2>
<p>From ordering stock to managing employees and producing marketing content, there’s little time to waste in a retail store. You probably have enough to do to keep you busy around the clock, but doing so wouldn’t be productive. Pick 1 or 3 urgent tasks and set out to resolve them today. Think of things that you’ll end up having to do from home if they don’t get done during work hours. Get the most pressing things, like building next week’s working schedule, out of the way first thing in the morning so you kick off your day feeling productive and less stressed. Remember our advice on empowering employees? <a target="_blank" href="https://en-ca.ondeck.com/blog/delegation-your-key-to-working-smarter/">Delegating tasks </a>and giving them their own daily goals of their own is a clever way to increase efficiency.</p>
<p>While your assistant manager orders in new stock, your sales associate can reorganize the cash area and you can call regular customers to inform them about new arrivals. Now that’s productive! Try to focus on one task at a time, it may feel counterintuitive but studies show that we lose on average 40% of our productivity when we try to juggle several tasks at once.In the hustle and bustle of a retail store, it can be tough to concentrate, but it pays off to do so. Go on ghost mode, tell your team that you need 30 minutes of uninterrupted office time to sort through emails or organize inventory before you can return to the sales floor. You’ll see, jobs that usually take twice as long will get done in record time!</p>
<p><strong> As the owner</strong>, you oversee every element of your business. From the cleanliness of your shelves to the type of stock that’s displayed on them, you know every step counts. Empower your business with the right technological tools, separate jobs based on skill sets and learn to prioritize for increased efficiency. Your operations will run more smoothly and you’ll be able to reclaim weekends for family, friends, and hobbies!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #00cc99">Why Making a Business Goal Pivot in the Summer is a Good Idea for Any Small Business Owner</span></h1>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><strong>By Lisa Hendrickson</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I run workshops for entrepreneurs. I asked a classroom full of entrepreneurs last week if they remembered what their goals were from the first of the year. I hear apprehensive laughter from the room. Then I ask if they remember their New Year’s Resolutions and of course, there’s some acknowledgement of those. “How many of you actually are working your resolutions now?” I ask. No one raises their hand.</p>
<p class="p1">Does this sound familiar? It should because this is the story for most of us who have great intentions and the motivation at the beginning of the year to make the necessary changes in our businesses and in ourselves but somehow we get lost in the next emergency and then it seems just too hard make those changes now. We might think “and besides, things aren’t so bad….”</p>
<p class="p1">This is why making a pivot in June, July or August is perfect for you and your company. In Lean Start Up circles, making a pivot means to substantially change something in the business model. You might want to consider that the pivot your company might make is not from the business model but from the operating model. So many of us are unconsciously operating our businesses from emergency to emergency or email to email instead of from vision and clarity around what we’d like to achieve.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, when the business was started it was someone’s dream—maybe yours. Now it might just be about keeping up with the pressures. Are you still connected to your dream every day? This is the key justification for goal setting&#8211;having your long range outcomes be connected with your day to day activities. In doing so, the realization of your vision has a pathway to be actualized.</p>
<p class="p1">Did that get you to dust off your notes with your annual goals listed out from the stack of paper you’ve got labeled in your head “important stuff I should get to sometime?” And when you looked at them did you realize that some of what you wrote down is out of whack with what you really want to happen with the business? No worries, I’ve got a simple system for you to employ mid-year to pivot and get moving towards what you really want to achieve.</p>
<h2 class="p1"><span style="color: #0074ff">It’s my “5Rs System” It’s quite simple:</span></h2>

<p class="p1">Review the goals that you set at the beginning of the year for yourself and see if the business is on its way to accomplishing one or more of them. You might find with some of the goals that the seed was planted and even though you didn’t remember that you wanted something, the business might be well on its way to achieving your long forgotten aim. Then there’s the other goals that were more “out of sight, out of mind.” That’s ok. Remember the year you wanted something so bad for your birthday and your parents didn’t or couldn’t get it for you? Can you actually remember now what that thing was? Yup, just like that goal you set in January.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff474a">R= Recalibrate:</span></h3>
<p class="p1">If you’ve set goals with timelines that have already passed, recalibrate those goals and the timelines so that you can approach it anew with a timeline that’s appropriate to where you’re starting now. Remember, if you recalibrate the timeline, you’re not behind, you’re not late and you haven’t blown it—you’ve got Q3 and Q4 finish the year strong. Take this all in stride.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff474a">R=Rip:</span></h3>
<p class="p1">“What was I thinking? Did I even write that or was that my evil twin?” If you’ve got goals like that listed but you don’t know why you would even think doing something like that is a good idea now, you need it rip it out of the plan and out of your consciousness. If you feel that goal isn’t remotely connected with what it is you are really committed to, tear it out like the bad weed in your flowerbed of life that it is. There’s no need to make extra work for yourself when you lack the commitment, the activities and the alignment with that goal. Just like a bad relationship, you can let it go….</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff474a">R=Recommit:</span></h3>
<p class="p1">Keeping the goals that you’re committed to and are the ones that connect you to the future that you see yourself creating will refresh and reenergize you and give you the motivation to get going again into goal achievement mode. My parents went to some kind of “Marriage Encounter” in the 70’s, I think was supposed to do something like that….</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span style="color: #ff474a">R=Revive:</span></h3>
<p class="p1">Taking actions in alignment with what you’re excited about producing that give you the future that you imagine for yourself will revive your enthusiasm and excitement for the business. You as the business leader know that if you’re happy and excited, that gets transmitted to your people. Your reengagement with goals can revive everyone’s enthusiasm in your company. Wouldn’t it be great to walk into your office and take a deep breath feeling refreshed and happy and your team doing the same thing? Awesomeness.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>I think that business and life</strong></span> is a series of forgetting and remembering. We start our businesses with an idea that lives at the 50,000 foot level and get excited about what we see at the horizon line. Then when we start engaging with our business at the 500 foot level, we can’t remember what it was that we saw way up high. Knowing when to fly above the day to day fray and live in the vision of the business and when to get down deep and get our hands dirty is a skill all its own. Goal setting and planning is the connection between our dreams that fly high above the blocking and tackling of the everyday that we do to make it. When we’re actively putting our goals into the forefront of our actions, we’re remembering our dreams. Like driving on an open road on a sunny day out west where all you can see is sky and imagine the possibility of what’s over just over the next hill, it’s our goals and inspiration that take us to our next destination.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Is Your Restaurant Social Media Marketing Ready?</strong></span></h1>
<p>When done correctly, the power of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> can help take your restaurant business to the next level and expand your customer base. By understanding critical areas of social media marketing, a restaurant can maximize their efforts in increasing its online presence and business revenue. In addition to maintaining a company website, keeping up with the changing landscape across several different digital platforms, such as Facebook, Yelp, and Instagram can help any restaurant business grow.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Facebook Business Page</strong></span></h3>
<p>The easiest way to create an online presence is to create a Facebook page for your restaurant. Make sure to complete the Facebook profile as much as possible because Facebook and other search engines will rank your restaurant <span style="color: #000082"><strong>higher in search results due to keywords and your page content</strong></span>. A Facebook page will be a place for the restaurant to post announcements and photos and for customers to leave comments, pictures and reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.26.21-PM.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-162031"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-162031" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.26.21-PM.png?resize=1656%2C1160&#038;ssl=1" alt="Facebook social media marketing for restaurants" width="1656" height="1160" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.26.21-PM.png?w=1656&amp;ssl=1 1656w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.26.21-PM.png?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.26.21-PM.png?resize=768%2C538&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.26.21-PM.png?resize=1024%2C717&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1656px) 100vw, 1656px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Having a page is the first step, but <span style="color: #000082"><strong>updating it regularly</strong></span> is the second. Ideally, you&#8217;d post your daily specials to bring people in, and take good-quality photos of your classic dishes. This space is also a great outlet for any special events or promotions your restaurant decides to have, since you can create an event page on Facebook and invite all those who &#8220;like&#8221; your restaurant. People will also be able to check in or tag your restaurant in their picture, which will tend expose your restaurant to their timeline. This is basically free advertising! Unless you pay to promote your Facebook page, simply running a Facebook page will help get the word out about your restaurant’s brand and encourage more people to visit.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Yelp Page</strong></span></h3>
<p>For any restaurant, Yelp will be the most common place your business will be found. Although it is not commonly thought of as social media, Yelp is still a public forum and digital space for searches. As the owner of an eating establishment, you can <span style="color: #000082"><strong>take the time to respond to negative and positive comments</strong></span> that stand out to you. This makes people feel like their concerns are being heard, and may opt to give you a second chance. Or if they wrote you a glowing review, graciously thank them, and it is more than likely that they will keep coming back! Both actions help establish an authentic relationship with customers and make them feel personally connected to your business.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.25.14-PM.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-162041"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-162041" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.25.14-PM.png?resize=1958%2C902&#038;ssl=1" alt="Yelp social media marketing for restaurants" width="1958" height="902" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.25.14-PM.png?w=1958&amp;ssl=1 1958w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.25.14-PM.png?resize=300%2C138&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.25.14-PM.png?resize=768%2C354&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.25.14-PM.png?resize=1024%2C472&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In terms of search engine optimization, Yelp and your Facebook Page will be close to the top. The search engine within the Yelp platform will use the content from the different paragraphs of “From the business” so fill it out as much as you can. You can also list your business up to three different categories on Yelp, which allows the business to be listed in more areas when searched. <span style="color: #000082"><strong>Being found through search results is just as important as personal referrals</strong></span>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Instagram</strong></span></h3>
<p>Another great way to showcase your restaurant&#8217;s food, decor, and atmosphere is through Instagram. Food is one of the <span style="color: #000082"><strong>most commonly posted subject posted on Instagram</strong></span>, with pizza at the number one spot followed by sushi and steak. Having an Instagram business account is a fundamentally a form of free advertising with unlimited space for photos and videos. By using hashtags to attract more followers and likes, this is a different type of exposure that benefits your restaurant brand. Just like Facebook, customers can add a location and/or tag your restaurant’s Instagram account in their post. Instagram now even has a contact option for business accounts so that customers can email or call the business directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.27.13-PM.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-162051"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-162051" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.27.13-PM.png?resize=1988%2C1154&#038;ssl=1" alt="instagram for restaurant social media marketing | small business loans" width="1988" height="1154" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.27.13-PM.png?w=1988&amp;ssl=1 1988w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.27.13-PM.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.27.13-PM.png?resize=768%2C446&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-15-at-12.27.13-PM.png?resize=1024%2C594&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1988px) 100vw, 1988px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you <span style="color: #000082"><strong>follow some of your loyal customers</strong></span> back or those who tag your restaurant, they too will feel like they have a relationship with your restaurant, even if it is just on social media. This way, they will continue to advocate for your restaurant business and will keep your restaurant in mind when they travel to your city and turn to social media and search engines to find good places to eat.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Why Social Media?</strong></span></h3>
<p>To run a successful restaurant today, particularly nowadays that people are constantly connected to their favorite social media outlets and apps, your restaurant also needs to be connected to these outlets to <span style="color: #000082"><strong>reach as many people as possible</strong></span>. You simply cannot get by just with taking out a print ad in a local newspaper or magazine. While those are also good things to do, especially if you want to be nominated for any of their awards, it is not enough, as you are limiting yourself to only the pool of prospective customers who actually read this particular magazine and subscribe to it, or the odd chance that someone in a hair salon might pick it up while their waiting and find out about your restaurant that way.</p>
<p>Social media is a tool useful for <span style="color: #000082"><strong>solidifying your name and brand into the consumer&#8217;s minds</strong></span>, so when the time comes to dine or plan a party or corporate dinner, they will choose <em>your</em> restaurant. Restaurant marketing starts with a comprehensive restaurant marketing plan or restaurant concept, which today includes social media, customer loyalty programs and new technology to streamline operations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner, you can’t afford not to invest in some form of marketing. But considering there are nearly as many ways to promote yourself as there are people, how do you know <strong>which small business marketing methods will pay off in real ROI</strong> and which ones will waste your resources?</p>
<p>Not every small business marketing budget can afford to call in the help of a professional, but truthfully, you do not need to. There are plenty of simple do-it-yourself solutions that will not drain your bank account or your time.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Check Out These Small Business Marketing Ideas That Won’t Break Your Budget:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Perfect Your Elevator Pitch</strong></span></h3>
<p>You should always stand ready to talk about your business. Spend some time crafting a succinct <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chicceo/2013/02/05/how-to-create-an-elevator-pitch/#1ef3151472a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevator pitch</a>, meaning <strong>a synopsis of your business in a condensed version, that not only details what you do, but also gives the listener a reason to want to learn more</strong>.</p>
<p>Typically you only have about <strong>8 seconds</strong> to grab their attention. Once you pique their interest, you’ve got about another minute to sell them. Practice your pitch until the words flow freely.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Request an Online Review or Testimonial</strong></span></h3>
<p>It does not matter what industry you serve, <a href="https://www.allbusiness.com/5-reasons-online-reviews-matter-to-your-business-108076-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online reviews</a> matter. In a survey conducted by Ask Your Target Market, an astounding <strong>90% of respondents indicated they have checked online reviews about a business</strong>. This means it’s highly likely some of your prospects have already scoped you out before they appeared on your radar.</p>
<p>Ask your best clients to rate your business or leave a review on Google or your social media pages. Incentivize them with a high profile prize drawing, or offer a coupon or other small reward to everyone who participates.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Ask for Referrals</strong></span></h3>
<p>Referral marketing is possibly the single most cost-effective marketing tactic you can employ, costing you as little as zero dollars and a few minutes of your time. However, there are a few <strong>dos and don’ts when it comes to asking customers to share their contacts</strong> with you:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>DO</strong></span> only ask happy, satisfied customers for referrals.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>DO</strong></span> provide an incentive to both the referral and to the person referring if their lead converts.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>DO</strong></span> make it a regular habit to ask for referrals.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>DON’T</strong></span> continually badger the same clients for referrals. They may feel that’s all they mean to you.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>DON’T</strong></span> let hot leads get cold. Follow up on all referrals immediately.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>DON’T</strong></span> ask yes-or-no questions to get a referral (ex. Do you know someone who might be interested in this service?). Keep questions open-ended.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Create Sticky Customers</strong></span></h3>
<p>Studies show it costs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-cost-customer-acquisition-vs-retention-ian-kingwill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 to 10 times more</a> to gain a new customer than it does to keep an existing one, so don’t forget to <strong>allocate some of your marketing budget to the people who already like you and know about your business</strong>.</p>
<p>Talk to your current customers about other products and services you offer. The key is to provide value as many different ways as possible so you can remain their go-to choice whenever they need something you offer. Creating a <a href="http://www.businatomy.com/blog/3-easy-ways-to-make-products-sticky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sticky customer</a> is a bit different than typical customer retention. While you don’t “lock in” a customer to your services, you do get them invested in multiple parts of your business that makes it a little more difficult for them to jump ship and switch to your competitor.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Employ Social Media Marketing</strong></span></h3>
<p>Nowadays, you’d be hard pressed to find a business of any size that isn’t established on social media in some way. Maintaining a <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent social presence</a> can help attract new customers and retain loyal customers by keeping yourself top of mind and sharing the ins and outs of what makes your business great.</p>
<p>And, contrary to popular belief, social media marketing does not always involve a hefty time commitment. <strong>Stick to these small business marketing secrets to stay on track</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only <strong>set up social media accounts on channels where your target audience is</strong> likely to be. You don’t have to be everywhere to get noticed.</li>
<li><strong>Start with one or two platforms</strong> and work from there – you may find that’s all you need, or all you can responsibly handle. This helps avoid the time-zapping, resource-draining “Social Media Fatigue” that plagues many small businesses who eventually determine that social media isn’t worth the effort.</li>
<li><strong>Use a scheduling tool</strong> like Hootsuite or Buffer to schedule posts on your behalf. This way, you can touch your social marketing less frequently yet still provide fresh content on a regular basis.</li>
<li><strong>Use Paid Ads to get directly in front of your target audience</strong>, and no one else. You set the amount to spend (even as little as five dollars!) and your social media channel goes to work putting your information in front of the people who most likely need it.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Start Using Video</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you’re looking to get in front of your audience and bring valuable traffic, start using video. Currently, video converts better than any other type of content on the Internet—especially on social media. According to a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/top-video-marketing-statistics#sm.00001ufk4d228kdcrz1cjd9a0hlrr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a>, social video generates 1200% more shares than text and images combined, what’s more, consumers are <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-delightfully-short-guide-to-adding-value-with-video-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">85% more likely</a> to buy a product after watching a product video.</p>
<p>With numbers like these, it’s hard to ignore the amount of potential adding video to your marketing efforts can bring to your business overall. It’s the best way to reach your audience, engage them, and <a href="http://slide.ly/blog/promo-video-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn them into loyal customers</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to its growing popularity, creating and publishing high quality video is no longer reserved for only big brands spending millions on advertising. Small businesses now have access to great DIY options and software that won’t break the budget. Between shooting video yourself, using <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/01/28/fb-live-video/#wFXBkAahxuqk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Live</a> or YouTube Live to air a broadcast, and using one of the many online tools that popped up over the past year, the options for affordable, professional-quality video are endless.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you don’t need to be a marketing expert or to allot a corporate-sized budget to effectively promote your company, nor do you need to commit a lot of time.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, it’s tempting to think that everything can be done online. After all, if you can tweet the pizza emoji at Domino’s and expect a piping hot pie to arrive within 30 minutes, how much more digital can things get?!</p>
<p>To this I say hold on! Don’t assume that all customers adopt these channels – at least not exclusively.</p>
<p>Take a step back to consider that even with all this technology at our fingertips, Google research reveals that <a target="_blank" href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2013/09/new-research-shows-that-70-of-mobile.html">70% of mobile searchers call a business</a> directly. The customer journey is more integrated than ever, crossing all forms of media and contact channels on the route to purchase.</p>
<p>No small business can afford to ignore that persistent ringing object in the corner of the office. In fact, it’s your conduit to a lot of new business and a closer connection to your existing customers!</p>
<p><strong>How to Get More Customers to Call</strong></p>
<p>Understanding that customers still want to call is an important first step, but it isn’t going to make anyone pick up the phone. That takes adjustments to your small business marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Here are seven ways small business owners can encourage more customer calls:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spend more on click-to-call (CTC) campaigns: </strong>We touched on ads above, so why not start there to drive up your inbound call volume? Find your most successful online advertising channel and work in some compelling campaigns with a CTC focus. Not only will your business see a spike in calls, you’ll be able to quickly compare performance to your existing online campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Review existing call policy and procedures: </strong>Does your current training emphasize the importance of customer calls? Your team needs to know that picking up the phone is a crucial part of building a reputation and winning new business. Take a look at your current practices to make sure that calls are answered promptly and given the same level of service that you would offer in-person.</li>
<li><strong>Use landing pages with a single call to action: </strong>When a promotional page emphasizes one course of action it increases the likelihood that potential customers will take that route. Make it clear that visitors should pick up the phone to receive a discount and they are much more likely to call.</li>
<li><strong>Get a more memorable number: </strong>If customers can’t remember how to get hold of you, calls – and sales – could be slipping away Add a memorable hook to your contact details by buying or licensing a custom phone number. A number with a memorable word, sequence, or similar digits aids recall and increases your call volume over time.</li>
<li><strong>Add your phone number to social networks: </strong>As with most online businesses, social networks accepted a long time ago that their users still value a contact number. That’s why you’ll see prominent space for those traditional contact details and dedicated call advertising options on their platforms. Use these spaces to display your most memorable contact number and, where possible, include language that urges customers to call.</li>
<li><strong>Take another look at traditional advertising channels: </strong>In your rush to spend marketing dollars online, it’s possible that you’ve forgotten about traditional forms of advertising. Give them another look. Ad space that used to be expensive in print publications and other offline spaces tends to be much affordable these days. These channels also align well with the desire to pick up the phone, making them a promising source of increased calls.</li>
<li><strong>Track your calls closely for strategy adjustments: </strong>To squeeze more from your call-focused campaigns, it’s important to know which are delivering. Use unique numbers or call tracking technology to help your marketing team separate different channels and review results from each. There are several excellent call tracking solutions out there. Pick the one that offers the best fit for your business and set about crunching the numbers from your numbers!</li>
</ol>
<p>As you embrace new ways to get customers to call, you’ll often find that your brand reputation sees an upswing as well. Use this positive sentiment to encourage word-of-mouth marketing initiatives.</p>
<p>What begins with a simple commitment to talk to more customers can quickly spiral into a multi-faceted marketing strategy for your small business!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a new business isn’t easy. Many first-time business owners do not realize how much goes into starting a new venture. Branding, logo-creation, finding office space, making sure you’ve got a viable product and hiring employees are likely among the first things you’ve thought about, but what about insurance? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching, getting a quote and buying insurance is not usually a step that entrepreneurs and business owners are excited about. Traditionally, small business owners will experience long waits on the phone and an even longer application process to get the coverage they need. To further complicate things, there isn’t much information readily available on the internet for first-time business owners or first-time insurance buyers to do their research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make things easier, we’ve created a shortlist of some of the most common and important insurance types for a business to get. This should help you get a good understanding of what insurance you may need to keep your business risk-free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get started: </span></p>
<p><b>General Liability Insurance*</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Liability Insurance is the most common insurance for a business to have. It will protect a business against two major liabilities: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodily Injury </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property Damage </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A General Liability Insurance Policy should cover you in the event of a lawsuit involving bodily injury (such as a slip and fall on your premises) and property damage. These policies will cover the cost of an attorney, the costs for an insurance investigation, any judgment or settlement and medical expenses in the case of a non-employee related injury.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Workers Compensation Insurance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers Compensation Insurance is the best protection your business can have should an employee get injured on the job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers Compensation Insurance will provide medical benefits and wage replacement to an employee who was injured while working for your business. It is important to understand that the wounded party can only access wage replacement and medical benefits if they forego their right to sue. This means that Workers Compensation Insurance will provide your business with dual protection against lost cash for an employee unable to work and the chance of a hefty lawsuit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>Commercial Property Insurance*</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial Property Insurance will protect your business’s physical assets. This includes items such as your office building, computers, equipment, supplies, inventory, or furnishings. Commercial Property Insurance will help you rest easy because your assets are covered if they are damaged, stolen, lost in a fire or a covered natural disaster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note, not all natural disasters are covered by this policy, so make sure you ask your broker or carrier which disasters are covered and which require extra insurance protection.</span></p>
<p><b>Next Steps: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know the most common insurance types for a small business, it’s time to get in touch with a broker or carrier to discuss risks that are specific to your business. Make sure you get clarification from your insurance provider to ensure that all of your risks are covered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can be tempting to put this off, but it’s important that you don’t. Insurance allows you focus on running your business instead of the risks associated with it.</span></p>
