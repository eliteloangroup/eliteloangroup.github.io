								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my role as CMO of OnDeck, I get to interact with small business owners almost every day. This means I get to learn about the different ways they manage their time to build a successful business. And, as a marketer, I’m also interested in how <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/big-marketing-dreams-on-a-small-business-budget_us_5798bdbae4b0e002a314706f?hootPostID=aad9635d8e669971336e9bf4f399bdac" target="_blank">small businesses reach new audiences</a> and get the most out of their current customer relationships. I am so inspired by our customers, and want to share their stories in our new series, OnDeck Onsite. This series visits OnDeck customers across the US, Canada and Australia, to learn more about the different ways they’ve grown their businesses.</p>
<p>One of the first businesses we visited was in our own backyard, New York City. OnDeck’s customers in New York have made a positive economic impact, contributing over $871 million in economic activity and created nearly 6,000 jobs, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Impact-Report.pdf" target="_blank">according to our Economic Impact study</a>. So as the leader in online lending, OnDeck empowers small businesses to achieve their goals, and it was exciting to meet a customer and small business owner who is doing exactly that, here in NYC.</p>
<p>Dave and Anne Brown from <a href="https://www.trapezeschool.com/default.php" target="_blank">New York Trapeze School </a>first tried trapeze 16 years ago after vacationing at Club Med.  Dave and Anne believed flying with trapeze was an amazing tool for helping people, and shortly thereafter brought trapeze to New York City. In 2002, Dave and Anne opened their first school in Manhattan, and got off to a great start after being featured in The New York Times and the infamous Sex and the City episode, “The Catch.”</p>
<p>With their success in New York, Dave and Anne opened additional locations in Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston. Most recently they opened a location in <a href="http://www.bkmag.com/2016/07/25/swinging-into-ecstasy-at-brooklyns-new-trapeze-school/" target="_blank">Brooklyn</a>, with the help of an OnDeck loan. I met with Dave and Anne in the first series of OnDeck Onsite and asked them 5 Questions on Marketing and being a small business owner.</p>

<p><em>Hi Dave and Anne, its great to meet you and be here in your new, fabulous Brooklyn studio. With locations in DC, LA, Chicago and Boston, and now Brooklyn, how do you market your locations so people know what Trapeze School is all about?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TSNY.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-141551"><img class="alignnone wp-image-141551" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TSNY.png?resize=50%2C49&#038;ssl=1" alt="TSNY" width="50" height="49" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>      <strong>Dave and Anne Brown, Founders of New York Trapeze School</strong></p>
<p>Back in 2003, our Manhattan location was featured in Sex and the City, and in 2012 Modern Family, so for New York we didn’t have to do that much advertising- we got it for free. However, we did do a lot of market research for our other locations and found that the majority of our customers hear about Trapeze School through word of  mouth, usually from a friend who flew with us. So our number one marketing tool is to make sure that our customers have a great experience so they tell their friends. We’ve even started a ‘Come Along’ program in a few cities, where if you bring three friends you get one class free. That’s seen good results so far.</p>

<p><em>That’s great. You also have a really strong social media following. How much time do you spend on social media and your online presence?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TSNY.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-141551"><img class="alignnone wp-image-141551" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TSNY.png?resize=50%2C49&#038;ssl=1" alt="TSNY" width="50" height="49" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>      <strong>Dave and Anne Brown, Founders of New York Trapeze School</strong></p>
<p>We have social media coordinators at all of our locations. It’s really important for the coordinators to be posting photos and videos 3-4 times a day to let people know if we have space in a class or running a special deal. We are on three channels; Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, really showing people how much fun and safe it is to fly.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/od_2.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-141531"><img class="wp-image-141531 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/od_2.png?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="od_2" width="50" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>     <strong>Andrea Gellert, CMO of OnDeck</strong></p>
<p><em>A multi-channel social media strategy is really important. How has the Brooklyn location positively impacted your business?</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TSNY.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-141551"><img class="alignnone wp-image-141551" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TSNY.png?resize=50%2C49&#038;ssl=1" alt="TSNY" width="50" height="49" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>      Dave and Anne Brown, Founders of New York Trapeze School</strong></p>
<p>The entire construction project in Brooklyn took about 2 years (20 months permitting and 4 months to build). The Brooklyn location opened only a few weeks ago, so it is hard to say exactly what the impact will be on our ROI, but if it is anywhere close to the success of the year round indoor location we had in Manhattan from 2008 until 2012, it will result in positive ROI in 3 to 5 years.</p>

<p>I really like doing what I started out to do, which is to put written procedures and processes in place so that all of our Trapeze School’s can operate the same way. We want the experience to be the same for all of our schools, even when we have different instructors in place, so that the locations can run by themselves and we can get some of our time back.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well-executed marketing can have tremendous value for your business. At the same time, poor or ineffective marketing can hurt you as much, if not more, than no marketing at all. The following marketing tips for small business owners are a great place to start.</p>
<p>The following foundational principles will guide you toward the best marketing decisions that yield the strongest results.</p>
<p><strong>1. Remember That Marketing Is About Your Customers</strong></p>
<p>The first priority for any business is to make sure you really understand your target market and what matters to them. “Target market” is another way of saying “a group of customers or potential customers who share some traits or commonalities, and as such have a good chance of wanting your product/service.”</p>
<p>The key for small business owners is always remembering that your target market is made up of individuals. One at a time, they will notice your business, investigate it, and, ideally, make a purchase. Each of these purchases depends on a single person saying “yes” at the right moment.</p>
<p>When you come up with a marketing plan or invest in a marketing tool, look for something that will speak to your customers, one person at a time. A useful exercise might be to put yourself into the customers’ shoes by asking yourself the following three questions: 1) What’s the key problem my business solves for my customers? 2) What do my customers say they like best about what I sell? And 3) If I were a potential customer, what types of marketing messages or materials would interest me? You should analyze each marketing possibility through this customer lens; it&#8217;s the best possible lens to use.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create Your Marketing Message</strong></p>
<p>No matter what type of product or service you offer, the way you present your business and what you’re selling is vitally important.</p>
<p>Presentation of your marketing message is about how you communicate with the outside world in every way, from the sign above your door to the image on your Twitter account, from the attire and attitude of your employees to the language on your website. The key is that the presentation is consistent across all of your communication channels so that your customer has a unified experience.</p>
<p>Before you create a single marketing piece, be it a Facebook page or a printed flyer, put some thought into the presentation of your marketing message. The seemingly small details, such as fonts or colors, descriptive language, and image choices, matter a great deal. Make sure that the piece works with the other visual references they have- when they get the flyer and go to your website, will it feel like the same company or two different ones? You want it to feel like the same company.</p>
<p>Get a second opinion if you’re feeling stuck about whether a particular choice reflects well on your business. And always spell check and proofread written materials more than once.</p>
<p><strong>3. Customize Your Marketing Plan</strong></p>
<p>Some marketing needs are nearly universal: nowadays, almost any business needs a clean, well-designed website. Not all the trends that float across the marketing space, however, are a good fit for your business. Determining your optimal “marketing mix” is critical in creating an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Should you invest in SEO? Print and distribute mailers? Pay for online ads? Develop a time-consuming social media strategy? These strategies are all helpful for many businesses. But that doesn’t mean they’re the right options for getting the word out about your products, or communicating with your customers. It could be that hosting local events and placing ads in the community paper might be just as effective for your business. It all depends on your business and your target market.</p>
<p>Any offer for a generic marketing tactic “guaranteed” to boost your business &#8211; from any firm or person who doesn&#8217;t know the details of your business &#8211; should be treated with skepticism. The need for marketing is universal; but the best ways to market are specific to each business.</p>
<p><strong> 4. Work Your Marketing Into the Operations Of Your Business</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to think of marketing as an afterthought. First I need to get the business going, you think, then I’ll invest in some good branding, and finally, get a marketing strategy together. It&#8217;s as if marketing is a decorative element you can add to an already-constructed building.</p>
<p>In fact, marketing isn&#8217;t decorative; it needs to be built into the structure, or else it&#8217;s ineffective. Good marketing means building into your business a format for communicating what you offer to the world. A way to know whether you have a good built-in strategy is that every one of your employees, from the managers to the busboy, knows what your business has to offer and how to share that offer with anyone interested, be it their neighbor or a stranger on the subway.</p>
<p>When you can see marketing as an integral part of your business, you will start seeing the natural and effective paths to communicating with individuals who are looking for the products or services you offer.</p>
<p><strong>5. Be Sure to Measure Results</strong></p>
<p>With any form of marketing, there’s an element of prediction: you won’t necessarily know before you start what’s going to deliver the best results. So one of the most important tasks in marketing is measuring how your current campaigns and materials are doing. Which means you need to create a way to measure the impact of your efforts.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to buy fancy tools to do this &#8212; there are a few basics available that any small business owner can use. One easy measurement tool is your voice &#8212; simply ask each customer how they found you. For marketing on your website, use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>, a free tool that lets you monitor traffic to a specific website, to give you information such as the number of people visiting, the time they’re spending on your page or pages, and where they’re coming from (a Google search, a referral from Facebook, etc.). Or if you send out emails, track the people who respond to them as well as consider investing in an email tool that can help you measure engagement such as email open rates or click through rates.</p>
<p><strong>From the moment you opened the doors of your business, you have been saying something about what you have to offer. Now is a great time to start defining and strategizing your marketing, so you can say what you want, in a manner that best communicates your message, to the audience you want to hear it.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salespeople may seem easy to find, but <a title="Three Steps to Hiring the Right People" href="https://www.ondeck.com/blog/three-steps-hiring-right-people/">top-performing salespeople are not</a>. Once you’ve put the time and resources into attracting a top talent, or developing skills in a new hire, you’ll want to invest time and energy into retaining them.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, and hold on to your best salespeople, follow these 4 steps:</p>
<p><b><b>1. Invest in their continuous development</b></b></p>
<p>Top salespeople want to always be developing their skills &#8212; it’s part of what makes them top salespeople. They are motivated by new challenges and responsibilities. “Make sure they get new experiences even if they don’t get new titles,” says Jake Dunlap, CEO of <a target="_blank" href="http://skaled.com/">Skaled</a>, which helps fast growth ventures develop their sales processes and systems. “That’s why salespeople stick around.”</p>
<p>Top sales performers also like to be recognized for their achievements, so if you can’t outright promote them, give them new opportunities to demonstrate their skills. That might include hiring an executive coach to work with them, to help them hone specific skills, or offering to mentor them.</p>
<p><b>2. Provide them with new challenges</b></p>
<p>Ongoing growth and professional development is important to high performers in any role, but especially in sales. Keeping your best salespeople learning and growing entails investing in them, says Dunlap, and making sure they know you’re doing it.</p>
<p>Such investments can range from sending a top performer to conferences or seminars to learn from the best, moving them into more complex selling situations, or assigning them larger territories to manage, suggests Joe Morone, principal in <a href="http://www.worldleaderssales.com/" target="_blank">Worldleaders </a>sales and training.</p>
<p><b>3. Help them reach their goals</b></p>
<p>Keeping salespeople engaged also requires understanding what motivates them as individuals. Why are they working so hard? What drives them?</p>
<p>Morone advises digging to discover what each salesperson is working toward. You might learn that one team member is saving for an early retirement, or looking to fund her child’s college education, or saving for a new car. Once you know specifics, you can “help them reach <i>their</i> goal, not <i>your</i> goal for them,” says Morone.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of discussing how many units a salesperson needs to sell <i>for the company</i>, you can discuss how many units it will take for them to reach that personal goal.</p>
<p>In addition, learn about their professional goals. Are they hoping for a promotion? Do they want a lateral move into a new part of the company? Where do they want to go next and how can you support them? If you don’t support these goals as well, the employee has no reason to stay long-term.</p>
<p><b>4. Eliminate poor performers</b></p>
<p>“High performers become frustrated when working alongside poor performers,” says Morone. This demotivating factor may be reason enough to ease those at the lower end of the spectrum to new opportunities, either inside or outside of the company.</p>
<p>Granted, this is easier to do when you’ve established clear performance goals and tracked who is (and isn’t) meeting them. “When a salesperson is two or more quarters behind on quota, it’s time to provide training or make a change,” Morone says.</p>
<p>Above all, “sales managers have to be committed to developing their salespeople,” says Morone. “Salespeople leave managers, not companies.” If you can forge bonds and provide ongoing support, you’ll successfully retain your best salespeople.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The point of marketing is to show current customers that you value their business, and to win the attention of potential customers. A business that consistently shows how much it values customers can consistently win customer attention. Here are six areas in which marketing can lead you to make decisions that will help your bottom line, and win you new business.</p>
<p><b>1. Market Research</b></p>
<p>You might love the idea of adding 27 flavors of hot sauce to your front-of-house kiosk, but that doesn&#8217;t mean your customers will agree. Good market research tells you what your customers want. If you&#8217;re thinking of expanding with a new location, increased product lines or service offers, market research can save you from making costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Reach into your existing customer database at random, ask pertinent questions, then analyze results. If you can, find industry-specific research to compare with your own results. It&#8217;s no good to discover after writing a check that your customers don&#8217;t want the new recliner options you’ve chosen to offer at your furniture warehouse.</p>
<p><b>2. Consistent Branding</b></p>
<p>Branding might seem like a lower priority, but it matters for building trust with your customers. Inconsistent branding choices make your potential customers wonder <a href="http://blog.oxfordcollegeofmarketing.com/2015/02/06/how-inconsistent-branding-breaks-down-customer-trust/" target="_blank">if they can trust you</a>. Consumers do judge on appearances. Trade in that logo designed back in grad school, and consider upgrading to consistent, professional branding, which eases the buy-in process for new customers.</p>
<p><b>3. Online Presence</b></p>
<p>Whether your business is selling anything online or not, your customers are shopping online. Today, <a href="http://www.retailingtoday.com/article/study-81-research-online-making-big-purchases" target="_blank">80% of consumers do research online</a> before they even come to your store. Having a strategic, well-mainlined online presence helps you get consumer eyes and, ultimately, consumer buys.</p>
<p>The more information you offer online, the easier it is for searching consumers to find you. Customers are online. Come to the customers. Otherwise, they&#8217;ll go to the competition.</p>
<p><b>4. Mobile Marketing</b></p>
<p>Mobile use is steadily increasing, with once again over <a href="http://www.cmo.com/articles/2014/5/6/Mind_Blowing_Stats_Online_Shopping.html" target="_blank">80% of consumers</a> using their mobile devices before they shop or while they browse in your store.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fight the trend; use it. Optimizing for mobile marketing puts you on the radar. As younger shoppers become more influential, mobile-friendly businesses will be the clear market winners.</p>
<p><b>5. Curb Appeal</b></p>
<p>Spruce up the showroom, update the signage, and redo that landscaping. The rise of digital marketing can make it seem brick and mortar locations are less important. But first impressions still matter.</p>
<p>Basic curb appeal can go a long way for brick and mortar businesses.</p>
<p><b>6. Local Presence</b></p>
<p>Word-of-mouth marketing is the original way to build a viral campaign.</p>
<p>In an age of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2014/12/10/consumers-are-no-longer-brand-loyal/" target="_blank">decreasing customer loyalty</a>, you can&#8217;t depend on being the oldest local biz on the block. Be active in your local community. Participate in community events. Sponsor community organizations. Cater to the local customers. Then talk about it on your website and social media. Your community spirit shows even far-away potential customers that yours is a business that values customers.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing can be an invaluable tool if you know where and how to focus your efforts. Use these areas to maximize your time and achieve real results.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a trap that many small business owners fall into, often without realizing it. Days are constantly packed, and the work week only seems to get longer, but there never seems to be enough time to slow down and handle certain tasks.</p>
<p>Business consultant <a href="http://momentumandmojo.com/" target="_blank">Joanne Macdonald</a> has created a system for escaping this trap, and improving both your business and your day-to-day life. &#8220;We&#8217;re all living in a reactive work environment,” she says. “Business owners have to get clear on the fact that they need to make time to build the business, not just react.” Here are her 4 steps to freedom from the Time Trap.</p>
<p><b><b>1. Determine Exactly How You’re Spending Each Hour of the Day</b></b></p>
<p>First, figure out what you&#8217;re doing. “Many times, my clients find that they are spending very little time on what they know to be their most important tasks,” she shares.</p>
<p>“Even tracking your time for a couple of days can be very enlightening. The more specific you can be, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, don&#8217;t just jot down &#8220;worked for three hours this morning.&#8221; That won&#8217;t tell you anything you don&#8217;t already know. Instead, write down each activity and interruption. Note when you take a Facebook break, when you get waylaid by a twenty-minute conversation, when a customer call takes an hour of your afternoon.</p>
<p>MacDonald recommends keeping it simple. &#8220;Evernote is great, on your computer or your phone. Or if a notebook works better, use a notebook.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>2. Slice Activities Into a Pie, and Stack Them According to Importance</b></p>
<p>Once you track your time, take a look at the major categories which take up your time. &#8220;Slice it up,&#8221; says Macdonald, &#8220;and see what size each slice is. Quite often the smallest slices  &#8211; tasks like forecasting finances, closing big sales, developing new products, or planning for expansion &#8211; are the ones you really should be spending more time on.”</p>
<p>Compare those slices to the priorities you have inside and outside of the business. &#8220;As an entrepreneur, a business owner, you need to get yourself to focus on building the business, not scurrying around inside of the business,&#8221; says Macdonald.</p>
<p><b>3. Delegate Any of Your Duties That Don’t Absolutely Require You</b></p>
<p>Macdonald recommends that all business owners get very clear on the tasks they need to do personally, such as developing plans and strategies, overseeing the big financial picture, and managing their managers.</p>
<p>Other tasks, such as bookkeeping, marketing, customer service, and inventory control, should be handed off to other people.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this handoff (and feel comfortable about it), business owners must first have a handle on the people and resources that are available to them. &#8220;You have to let go of the need to do it all yourself,&#8221; says Macdonald. &#8220;Would you rather micromanage everything, or have a successful business?&#8221;</p>
<p>Look to outsource tasks that don’t need someone within the company in order to be performed well. Tools and apps are also affordable, and many can get you working more efficiently.</p>
<p><b>4. Document Processes for Important Things That Happen (Or Could Happen) With Your Business</b></p>
<p>How do you handle the inevitable angry customer, inventory issue, or other unforeseeable business calamity? Says Macdonald, &#8220;You can never get away from all of the daily business needs, but you can minimize distractions.&#8221; Do so by laying out specific guidelines and procedures, not only for day-to-day operations, but also for crisis situations.</p>
<p>Macdonald recommends that business owners schedule a day each quarter to map out guidelines, procedures, and policies. Once the daily duties of normal business are documented, work on putting together guidelines for situations like computers crashing, products not working, or negative online reviews.</p>
<p>Documenting in this way will minimize the need for your personal intervention every time a crisis arises. Above all, fight the temptation to micromanage every part of your business; it limits you and limits your employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you struggle,&#8221; says MacDonald, &#8220;get yourself accountability with a business partner, spouse, or peer group.&#8221; Have them hold you accountable for following your own documented processes, and letting your employees do so as well.</p>
<p><strong> If you want to succeed and grow your business, there&#8217;s no magic trick. But you can release yourself from the Time Trap by sticking to priorities, revisiting your goals regularly, documenting and delegating, and putting accountability in place.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner, you’re undoubtedly busy. But just how productive are you? The two aren’t the same thing, and many small business owners need smart strategies and strong time management skills to keep their days from being eaten up by emergencies, and other people&#8217;s priorities.</p>
<p>Here are five essential steps that will help turn your busy-ness into real and lasting productivity.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Realize that you must manage your time.</b></p>
<p>For the busy business owner, learning to manage your time isn&#8217;t optional &#8212; it&#8217;s essential. To run an organized, efficient, and effective business, you need to first learn how to be organized, efficient, and effective yourself.</p>
<p>Since you juggle many responsibilities and job roles, you must be able to quickly see what deserves your attention and what doesn&#8217;t. Otherwise, your time is guaranteed to be wasted, for at least part of the day. You&#8217;ll be consumed by non-essential tasks, and the important work will never get done.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel bad about taking time out of the day-to-day to learn how to manage time. “Time is the scarcest resource,&#8221; said renowned management expert Peter Drucker, &#8220;and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Realize that you’re the only one who can say “No.”</b></p>
<p>Even the most capable and well-meaning employees, assistants, and friends cannot do the one thing you can do: say No for you.</p>
<p>Other people will not leave you alone when they see how busy you are. Other people will not understand or respect your priorities. Other people will not protect your hours for you.</p>
<p>Once you take full responsibility for your time, you can start setting limits and making decisions that protect it. You can learn and apply strategies that will help you to resist distractions. You can train yourself to focus on essentials.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get trapped by your expectations for other people; instead, take charge of your own days. Say No to everything that pulls you away from the key actions that propel your business forward.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Deal with interruptions on your own terms.</b></p>
<p>Over the next few days, start to notice how much pops up during your day that isn’t on your priority list. These interruptions often come via phone calls, emails, and unplanned conversations.</p>
<p>It’s not that you shouldn’t be accessible; you need to answer questions, equip employees, and handle important communication. But you don’t have to handle every request as it comes in throughout your day.</p>
<p>Corral the interruptions by setting certain times to return phone calls, answer email, answer employee questions, respond to memos, and other tasks. Designate and then publicize a time for those needs; deal with a batch, all at once, and save yourself the stress of continual interruptions all day long. By designating an hour every morning to return phone calls, you can quickly get through them all, then focus on other higher-level tasks.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Plan out every hour of your day.</b></p>
<p>This one may sound labor intensive, but it’s critical. The fact is, planning lets you become proactive rather than panicked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity begins with having a plan,&#8221; says David Scarola, Vice President of executive peer advisory network <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thealternativeboard.com/">The Alternative Board</a>. &#8220;Rather than addressing tasks as they come up (emails, meetings, etc), it&#8217;s important to schedule and prioritize your day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spend a little time every night or every morning making a plan for the upcoming day. When you get derailed by a crisis, manage it, then go right back to your plan.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Identify and tackle your productivity weaknesses</b></p>
<p>You might be great at writing all your tasks down in a list and sticking to it, but you might be bad at saying no to items that shouldn’t be there in the first place. Or maybe you excel at identifying your priorities, but tend to get lost in details and never finish a project.</p>
<p>If you can be honest enough to see where your skills are lacking, you can overcome your weaknesses. No one is perfect, including at productivity. Work to actively develop the skills you don’t have that hold you back. Get people who are strong in those areas to hold you accountable. Take a course. Read a book. Get a coach. Improving your basic time management skills is an investment that benefits your entire business.</p>
<p>These five steps won&#8217;t eliminate all the interruptions and distractions that are part of owning a business. But they will help you to handle them more efficiently, and learn to be powerful with your own time.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Performance reviews can be dreaded by employees and employers alike. But good feedback can be a vital tool for employee productivity, and happiness. Use these three tips from experts to help you make performance reviews appreciated, not dreaded.</p>
<p><b>1. Cut out an annual review, and switch to regular performance feedback</b></p>
<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of performance reviews, for employees, is the vast length of time between them. They hear nothing for months, then get a serious annual meeting that details all of their shortcomings for an entire year.</p>
<p>Authors Samuel Colbert and Larry Rout state <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128362511#128367260" target="_blank">in their book</a> that &#8220;annual reviews do not promote candid discussions about problems in the workplace — and their potential solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>What to do? Quit giving feedback altogether? That&#8217;s not the answer either.</p>
<p>Employees <a href="http://www.discoverysurveys.com/articles/itw-087.html" target="_blank">need and even crave feedback</a> on their work. But they need it regularly: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/05/06/time-to-scrap-performance-appraisals/" target="_blank">monthly and even weekly</a>, so that they can adjust and improve continually.</p>
<p>Make it your habit to meet, informally, with each of your employees on a weekly or monthly basis. Regular, short-and-sweet (under 30 minutes) reviews — limited to current performance and projects — will be much more beneficial than a yearly feedback fest.</p>
<p><b>2. Set objective standards to avoid any misunderstandings or bias</b></p>
<p>Good leaders don&#8217;t intend to be biased, of course, but sometimes people are blind to their own internalized assumptions and preferences.</p>
<p>When you give feedback based solely on your subjective appraisal of how well a job is being done, you&#8217;re probably falling into <a href="http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/rgbr/vol1iss1/performance_appraisals.shtml" target="_blank"><i>rater bias</i></a>. That&#8217;s when the reviewer is, consciously or inadvertently, influenced by &#8220;non-performance related factors&#8221; of the employee, such as personal characteristics (race, gender, age, personality) and interpersonal factors (whether or not the reviewer personally &#8220;likes&#8221; and gets along with the employee). Employees, justifiably, <a href="http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/rgbr/vol1iss1/performance_appraisals.shtml" target="_blank">feel wronged</a> &#8220;because managers do not always rate them on objective criteria.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bias is not only frustrating for employees, it&#8217;s bad for business. &#8220;When a manager or supervisor is in a bad mood,&#8221; the <a href="http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/rgbr/vol1iss1/performance_appraisals.shtml" target="_blank">same research</a> finds, &#8220;he or she is a much more conscientious performance rater and more attuned to employee mistakes and problems. When in a good mood, the manager is more likely to overlook poor employee performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, you might have a bad morning, then take it out on one of your best employees.</p>
<p>Feedback should encourage great performance or give specific actions and standards to improve poor performance, not disintegrate into a personal venting session. To avoid letting bias and mood ruin the reviews you give, set clear, objective standards for each job role or employee position.</p>
<p><b>3. Tailor your feedback to each employee’s experience</b></p>
<p>You probably think you know what your employees want to hear: positive feedback, praise, assurances that their work is satisfactory, even excellent. Turns out that’s not entirely true. What employees want to hear depends on how skilled they are in particular tasks or roles.</p>
<p>For newbies, praise is paramount. “Novices sought and responded to positive feedback,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalog/tell-me-i-wrong-experts-seek-respond-negative-feedback/">this study</a> finds, and &#8220;positive feedback increased novices&#8217; commitment.&#8221;</p>
<p>For advanced employees, however, apparently getting only positive feedback is like giving a teenager a pat on the head: useless (at best) and irritating (at worst). <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalog/tell-me-i-wrong-experts-seek-respond-negative-feedback/" target="_blank">The study found</a> that &#8220;experts sought and responded to negative feedback.&#8221; These employees actually want negative feedback on the areas in which they’re most skilled. Truthful feedback motivates them to want to make more progress.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-ideal-praise-to-criticism" target="_blank">a little goes a long way</a>. Those high-level employees still appreciate genuine praise and encouragement, but they also appreciate thoughtful insight that will help them increase their skills and expertise.</p>
<p><strong>As a small business owner, you probably know your employees well. Keep in mind, then, during those regular reviews, the skill levels for each employee. Encourage and praise to help employees stay committed to a new role or skill; encourage with some insightful critiques to help advanced employees stay motivated to improve. </strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a business owner, you do a daily dance between handling the latest customer crisis, managing employees, overseeing finances, and doing the stuff of actual production. You&#8217;re left with one giant, unavoidable question: <i>how am I supposed to do it all?</i></p>
<p>According to author and productivity expert <a href="http://patrickrhone.net/" target="_blank">Patrick Rhone</a>, you&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the three best productivity tools are the trash can, the delete key, and the word ‘no,’&#8221; says Rhone. Here’s a rundown of the three.</p>
<p><b><b>1. Using the Trashcan: Clear Your Physical Environment</b></b></p>
<p>If you want to do it all, start with the space immediately around you. Clutter can make it <a href="https://unclutterer.com/2011/03/29/scientists-find-physical-clutter-negatively-affects-your-ability-to-focus-process-information/" target="_blank">more difficult for you to focus</a> and get your work done.</p>
<p>Rhone suggests, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Straight-Patrick-Rhone-ebook/dp/B004YR6PXG/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426768756&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=patrick+rhone" target="_blank"><i>Keeping It Straight</i></a>, that you identify every item you handle in your office/workspace, and ask, &#8220;Where does this belong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer is &#8220;not here.&#8221; Spend an hour dealing with your most-used workspace, and make a pile of the things that belong in the &#8220;not here&#8221; category.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to put your trash can (or recycle bin, or donation box) to good use. As Rhone states, &#8220;…if something does not have a place in your home, in your relationships, in your job, or in your life, perhaps it should not be there at all.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>2. Using the Delete Key: Handle Your Digital Inbox</b></p>
<p>Email is beneficial for business owners, certainly; it lets you communicate with groups, send and receive quick answers, confirm information, and avoid endless games of phone tag.</p>
<p>But the instantaneous accessibility of email &#8211; which provides those benefits &#8211; can lead to an overload of questions, requests, and needs piling up for your response. To handle email, Rhone suggests a few simple but powerful methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Get to know your &#8216;Delete&#8217; key…use this key for a vast majority of the email that you receive.&#8221;</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t check email constantly during the day. Choose specific 20-minute increments two or three times a day to handle all incoming messages that are not critical. It&#8217;s better, Rhone says, to &#8220;process in chunks rather than nibbling away at each message as it arrives.&#8221;</li>
<li>Handle each email by asking, &#8220;Does this require action?&#8221; If the answer is no, &#8220;delete it or archive it immediately,&#8221; says Rhone. If the email requires action, Rhone recommends either dealing with it immediately, or, if more time is required, moving it to a folder labeled &#8220;Action&#8221; for later response.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Saying No: Clarify Your Task List</b></p>
<p>What do you want to be?</p>
<ul>
<li>A rushed, stressed, overwhelmed person?</li>
<li>A calm, successful, happy person?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are rushed, stressed, and overwhelmed at work, that&#8217;s how you will be at home, with friends, with family, anywhere. The alternative is to decide who you want to be, and then let that determine what you do.</p>
<p>Make a list of all the tasks that fill your day that don’t fit who you want to be, then figure out how to minimize or quit doing them. For work tasks, either, a) eliminate from your business altogether; or b) hand them off to a qualified employee, consultant, or outsourced professional.</p>
<p>A truism of life is that there will always be more needs, and more opportunities, than there are hours in your day. But trying to do it all is not the answer. Instead, choose carefully what should get past the trash can, the delete key, and the word &#8220;no&#8221; and into your hours.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><i>Are you a small business owner because you have to be, or because you want to be?</i></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important question to answer. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p><b><b>1. Passion Is Better for Business</b></b></p>
<p>&#8220;Business is best when people providing goods and services feel passion and commitment to what they are producing,”  says <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorhwang/2013/03/27/whats-better-for-business-logic-or-feelings-answers-from-neuroscience/" target="_blank">neuroscience business expert Janet Crawford</a>.</p>
<p>Passionate business owners are better at what they do. When it comes to overcoming challenges, sharing the vision behind the business, persuading and leading people, passion <a href="http://faculty.bschool.washington.edu/skotha/scans/Passion_BP.pdf" target="_blank">gives people an edge</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for your business, if the passion is indeed present.</p>
<p><b>2. Passion Will Keep You Driven</b></p>
<p>Once things get tough (and when it comes to running a small business, they inevitably do) passion will keep you getting out of bed at 7 AM to face a seemingly-endless To Do list. Ask yourself these questions when it comes time to reconnect with your passion:</p>
<p><i>What led me here?</i></p>
<p>Think back to the beginnings of your story. What choice, or set of choices, did you make? Why? If you chose out of fear, desperation, pressure from others, or lack of options, it&#8217;s time to consider if it&#8217;s the right decision for you. If, on the other hand, you acted (at least partially) from desire and interest, to solve a problem, with enthusiasm, joy, and/or a clear purpose, you&#8217;re probably right where you want to be.</p>
<p><i>What do I love about my business?</i></p>
<p>Your forté may be sales, but you find yourself spending hours behind a computer. Or perhaps you excel at analytics and strategy, but all your time goes to handling personnel issues and customer crises. Make a list of the positives (what gets you excited about work) and the negatives (what makes you want to hide from work). It doesn&#8217;t matter if the negatives outnumber the positives; it does matter that the positives are at the heart of your business.</p>
<p><b>3. Passion Will Help You Manage Stress</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that you know the passion is there. It doesn’t change the fact that running a business is still difficult work. More than 50% of business owners work <a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/379/passion-work.aspx" target="_blank">50+ hours per week</a>. Many small business owners <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/vacation-study" target="_blank">don&#8217;t take a vacation</a>, and of those who do, most only take <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/08/13/fun-in-the-sun-not-for-many-small-business-owners/" target="_blank">5 days off per year</a>.</p>
<p>The stress of business ownership is a natural response to the demands you face. Without an inherent sense of value and interest in your business, you can easily grow to resent the fact that your business requires so much of your life.</p>
<p><b>4. If You Know You Had Passion at the Start, You Can Always Revive It</b></p>
<p>Sure, you&#8217;ll have bad days. But if you started with passion, and learn to use the steps above to revive it, you&#8217;ll have more good days than rough ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that list of positives and negatives? Your goal is to strike as many of those negatives from your list as possible. You do so by eliminating them altogether, automating them, delegating them, or outsourcing them. Working in your strengths <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/379/passion-work.aspx">increases your passion</a>.</li>
<li>Create a reminder of what makes this business matter to you. Go back to the beginning. Write your story out, or tell a friend or family member. Find a phrase or image that reminds you of the purpose and joy you feel in what you&#8217;re doing, and put it in your main work area.</li>
<li>Dedicate time to big-picture thinking. You may take joy in the details of day-to-day management, but without big-picture thinking on a regular basis, you will lose the vision that drives you and find a bunch of negatives creeping back onto your list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Passion isn’t the only thing required to build a healthy business; but having it makes the work better for you, your team, and your customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you properly compensate a sales team? Your sales employees can make or break your business. But knowing how to manage, and properly incentivize them to do a great job day in and day out can be tricky. Here is a breakdown of what you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>The Options</strong></p>
<p>Some companies pay their sales team on a salary basis, such as in some retail chains; others are commission-only, such as in recruiting or real estate; while the majority offer a combination of salary and bonuses based on performance. Today, the typical base salary-to-commission ratio is 50/50 or 60/40.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Incentives</strong></p>
<p>“There is no such thing as the perfect sales compensation plan,” says Jake Dunlap, CEO and founder of <a href="http://skaled.com" target="_blank">Skaled</a>, a company that helps fast-growth ventures develop their sales processes and systems. So instead of striving for a perfect system that doesn’t exist, try to incentivize the behavior and results you want.</p>
<p>For example, companies selling low-cost products or services &#8212; under $300 to 400 &#8212; are very transaction oriented. To keep salespeople motivated to make those non-stop sales, employers should use regular sales contests to drive higher volumes. The salesman or woman who has the highest numbers for the month will win a prize, be it a desirable item (like an iPad) or extra compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Floors and Bonuses</strong></p>
<p>Many companies set a sales floor, as well as a bonus plan for their sales team.</p>
<p>A “floor” is the minimum amount that needs to be sold to earn anything above the salesperson’s base salary. What’s the right way to set a floor? Dunlap suggests a standard would be 75% of the total monthly sales quota. Meaning that, unless 75% of the total quota is met, the salesperson receives no additional compensation that month.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, sales pros who meet and then exceed their sales quotas qualify for bonuses tied to those additional sales. These bonuses can consist of a higher commission per sale over the quota &#8212; a.k.a., you’d earn 15% of every sale instead of the standard 10% after 10 units are sold.</p>
<p>The other bonus structure is flat bonuses based on tiers of performance, such as an extra $1,000 for every additional $25,000 sold.</p>
<p>According to Dunlap, some salespeople will find creative ways of managing their quotas, such as timing sales to ensure they fall in the next calendar month, when the count starts back at zero. This can be a problem for some companies, especially for products or businesses where sales need to be done quickly. As such, smart companies can create compensation plans that discourage this practice, called sandbagging.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Sandbagging</strong></p>
<p>Dunlap’s favorite compensation approach is a monthly plan with a quarterly bonus. Using this system, salespeople have both a floor and a monthly bonus tied to their sales quota.</p>
<p>To discourage sandbagging, he also recommends a quarterly bonus that is paid on top of monthly bonuses. Here’s one example: As soon as you hit your quarterly quota, you earn 20% (instead of 15%) on all deals above that, so you’re incentivized to close deals as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The timing of payments to your salespeople can be tricky when your team is selling higher value products and services that take many months to close. In enterprise sales, where the value of the sale exceeds $40,000, salespeople are usually compensated on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Paying Based on Team Performance</strong></p>
<p>A less common, but still used, approach is team-based compensation. In larger sales organizations, where sales professionals are divided into teams, these compensation programs can take into account your own performance, your team’s performance, and your division’s sales performance.</p>
<p>In these situations, 50% of the compensation is often based on the individual, 30% on the team, and 20% on the division. While this may be appealing to companies, it’s usually less appealing to your sales team, unless they’re placed on an established, high-performing team. Otherwise, the potential downside is bigger than the upside.</p>
<p>“I’m not a big fan of team-based compensation when you’re rapidly growing,” says Dunlap, because fast growth requires a steady stream of new hires who will bring the team’s sales total down.</p>
<p>The monthly plan with quarterly bonus, on the other hand, incentivizes individual salespeople to close quickly and frequently.</p>
<p><strong>The Ideal Scenario</strong></p>
<p>The most effective sales compensation programs encourage salespeople to close as many deals as possible as quickly as possible, and then they pay out commissions as close to when deals are done as possible, says Dunlap. This keeps both the employer and the salesperson happy.<br />
