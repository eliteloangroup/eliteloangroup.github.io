								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner or entrepreneur, you are probably an expert in the actual product or service provided by your company. However, you may not be as well versed in the procedures and processes that are necessary to keep your business operating. While the particulars of each business naturally vary, there are several common features that every small business should maintain to ensure solid operations. This list represents some of the most essential functions involved in keeping a company up and running.</p>
<h3>Maintain Company Financial Records</h3>
<p>Financial and accounting functions include handling taxes, payroll, and bank statements, as well as invoices, contracts, and payments. If you or your staff members travel for business, those expenses must be accounted for as well. Even without trading in public stock, your company is also responsible for generating financial reports such as loan statements, revenue or sales forecasting, office or manufacturing space expenses, and equipment purchases or leases. <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/why-your-gross-profit-margin-is-your-mvp-no-matter-what-game-youre-playing">Accurate record keeping</a> for revenue and expenses is essential, whether they are assigned to an office manager in house or contracted to an outside accountant.</p>
<h3>Update and Human Resource Records</h3>
<p>Unless you are a sole proprietor, your company must maintain human resource records. These records include applications or resumes and job descriptions. Regulations for allowed absences, sick leave, vacation time, and other time-off policies should be established in writing and made available to each employee on your payroll. Your company should also establish a code of conduct, with clear guidelines for allowable and prohibited conduct and provisions for discipline or dismissal. Guidelines for resolving interpersonal conflicts should also be put in place.</p>
<p>Other necessary human resource related functions health insurance, retirement benefits, and unemployment insurance. Your company may also <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/makings-cents-small-business-benefits-benefits-package">offer additional perks</a> such as educational reimbursement. You should have written policies in place for dealing with each of these areas. It’s also smart to establish policies for meeting ADA requirements and providing workers’ compensation, even if you never anticipate needing either program.</p>
<h3>Set a Budget for Marketing and Promotions</h3>
<p>Your company likely doesn&#8217;t have a huge budget for glossy magazine ads or TV commercials. However, almost every company devotes at least some of its budget toward marketing and promotions. <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/5-tips-to-evaluating-your-small-business-social-media-marketing">Social media</a> ads, SEO keywords, email campaigns, and internet marketing are all relatively low-cost means of promoting your business to existing and prospective customers and clients. Establishing a budget along with record keeping for marketing and promotional expenses helps to ensure that those dollars are spent efficiently.</p>
<h3>Institute Computer and IT Policies</h3>
<p>Computers play a significant role in training, record keeping, and document transition for nearly every company. Your company should keep records of hardware and software in use, as well as established schedules for maintenance, repairs, upgrades, and replacement. <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/4-small-business-security-considerations">Security</a> is also a major area of concern. Your company should have clear, written procedures in place regarding internet access, as well as email and electronic document transmission. Strong security measures are especially critical in BYOD (bring your own device) environments where employees use their own mobile devices or personal computers for their jobs.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Periodic checks should be conducted to assess risk levels for security breaches for your company’s computer and IT setup. Backups of mission critical records and recovery plans should be a priority, with redundancy built in to minimize vulnerability for loss due to fire, flood, software or hardware failure, malware, or ransomware.</p>
<h3>Plan for Physical Safety and Security</h3>
<p>Your company should have a plan in place for dealing with emergencies including exit policies and escape routes in case of fire or natural disaster. There should be an established schedule for maintenance, repair or replacement of HVAC equipment, as well as a contingency for handling critical breakdowns. Periodic checks should be made to ensure that windows doors and locks and doors operate properly. Procedures for preventing unauthorized access, such as automatic locks or keycard entry for workers should also be in place.</p>
<h3>Conduct a Procedural Audit</h3>
<p>Once you’ve determined the functions and policies that pertain to your business, the next step is keeping track of ongoing operations. Performing a procedural audit of your company at periodic intervals ensures the continued smooth operation of your business. A procedural audit focuses on the results of your company’s strategies, policies or procedures, and indicates which areas of your company are operating efficiently, along with disclosing areas or where policies or procedures are not being properly followed. A procedural audit can also suggest adjustments to areas that may need improvement.</p>
<h3>Engage Your Employees</h3>
<p>In many companies, the employees who are closest to the work represent the best sources for insight on efficient operations and ideas for improving procedures. This is especially true in a small company where employees almost always wear multiple hats. It’s a smart strategy to provide bonuses, rewards, or other incentives for employees who provide innovative ideas or hacks to improve procedural efficiency. Gift cards, magazine subscriptions, or other modest tokens provide recognition without breaking the bank.</p>
<h3>Put the Pieces Together</h3>
<p>Running a company involves more than providing actual products and services. It is also necessary to deal with the various moving parts of any company’s operations. Determining which areas pertain to your business and establishing a reliable record keeping system helps to ensure smooth operations. Periodic procedural audits determine which areas of your company are running smoothly and which areas need attention or adjustment.</p>
<p>It is almost a given that at some point an audit or assessment will reveal malfunctioning or outdated equipment. Or perhaps additional personnel are needed <span class="fr-style">—</span> either short term or as permanent hires.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business may make money, but is it actually profitable? Unless you maintain an accurate and current accounting system, there is no way you can really be sure. There are two basic accounting systems: cash-based and accrual-based. The main difference between accrual and cash-based accounting systems relates to the timing of revenue and expenses. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>How you maintain accurate financial records plays a major role in ensuring that your company is truly profitable. Understanding the accounting process can help you make the right choice for your company.</p>
<h2>Accrual versus Cash-Based Accounting Systems</h2>
<p>Cash-based accounting recognizes actual revenue and expenses. Revenue is reported only after it has been received while expenses are only recorded when they have been paid. Cash-based accounting is more straightforward for the simple reason that tracking cash is easier. As a result, it is typically employed by small businesses, entrepreneurs and consumers. There&#8217;s a downside though. Cash-based accounting can overstate your company’s financial health, particularly if there are large reserves of cash on hand, but unpaid accounts payable that exceed the amount of cash available to cover them.</p>
<p>By contrast, the accrual accounting method focuses on revenue and expenses that are anticipated but have not yet been posted. Under the accrual method, revenue is recorded when a sale is made, even if the actual funds will only be received at a later date. Likewise, expenses are recorded as soon as a bill or invoice is received, regardless of the due date or the date that the invoice is actually paid.</p>
<p>The accrual accounting method is also more complicated to implement and maintain than the cash-based method, which might present a strain to a small business without an accountant or bookkeeper. Nonetheless, the accrual method presents a more consistent picture of earnings over time, which makes it the accounting system of choice for many companies.</p>
<h2>Make More Income Than You Have in Expenses</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether your company employs a cash-based or an accrual accounting system, your company must generate more income than expenses if you hope to remain in business. Ongoing shortfalls are a red flag that something is awry in your company’s revenue generation, revenue collection, expenditures or a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>Of course, revenue (and cash flow in particular) are frequently at a premium in a small business. At the same time, it is often necessary or advisable to make investments in equipment, supplies or added personnel. In such instances, It can make sense to take out a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/guides-small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business loan</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is one thing to take a loan to purchase an expensive piece of equipment that will allow your company to operate more efficiently. It is quite another to fall into a continuous cycle of borrowing and repayments.</p>
<h2>Why You Shouldn’t Put Off Your Accounting to the Last Minute</h2>
<p>Especially for a small business where everyone wears multiple hats, it’s tempting to put off generating and maintaining financial statements. However, delaying the task of accounting can have adverse effects on your company’s bottom line. Failure to maintain accurate accounting records can leave you unable to gauge your company’s actual financial health. Without an accurate financial picture for your company it is simply impossible to know whether your costs are excessive or whether your financial resources permit expansion.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for many small businesses, accounting is viewed as a chore that distracts from the actual products or services that the business provides. However, your company’s revenues and expenses won’t record themselves. At some point, without regular attention, the task of maintaining your company’s books will become insurmountable and you&#8217;ll have little choice but to hire a professional — most likely a certified public accountant (CPA) — to clean up the mess. This is a cost you could likely do without.</p>
<p>On the other hand, keeping your company’s books up-to-date makes accounting much less of a chore. The key is to take care of posting revenues, expenses and other financial records immediately, while they are fresh in your mind. Accounting software such as Quickbooks or Freshbooks perform much of the heavy lifting number-crunching and will help you maintain a running tally. However, poorly organized records won’t be magically transformed into pristine financial statements by plugging them into an accounting software program!</p>
<p>That said, a small business can produce useful and accurate financial statements with a relatively simple classification system. Useful categories for a small business accounting ledger include accounts payable, accounts receivable, employee payroll, employee benefits, taxes, bank statements, permits and licenses, equipment and supplies, liability coverage and overhead (such as rent, equipment maintenance and supplies).</p>
<h2>Maintaining a Positive Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Establishing and maintaining a current and accurate accounting system is vital to the financial health of your company. There are two generally recognized accounting systems. Cash-based systems are easier to implement and maintain, but can overstate the financial health of a company that is flush with cash but saddled with numerous financial obligations. The accrual method is more complex, but produces more consistent reports over time.</p>
<p>Each method has advantages and drawbacks and the right choice depends on your company’s specific circumstances. What’s important is to maintain accurate financial records in order to gauge whether your company is actually turning a profit.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner, you may be uncertain about how to articulate your <strong>value proposition</strong>. You may even be unclear on the concept of just what a value proposition is. Simply put, a value proposition is a marketing statement that describes why a prospective customer or client should choose your company over a competitor.</p>
<p>A good value proposition represents an excellent foundation for an overall sales or marketing plan. However, building on that, you&#8217;ll also require a solid understanding of the basics of sales, your company’s products and customer base, and your capability to deliver. This all leads to the important first step of developing an effective elevator pitch. Then, it&#8217;s all about following through on that pitch, closing the deal and managing your customer or client base on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>This article explores key steps in that process of showing a prospective customer why they should buy from you.</p>
<h2><strong>The Basics of Sales</strong></h2>
<p>Sales, advertising, and marketing perform different functions, but all three have the same essential goal – increasing your company’s customer or client base. There are two basic concepts to any sales pitch: convincing customers or clients their needs (or desires) can be met by your company, and demonstrating that your company is better equipped to meet those needs or desires better than the competition.</p>
<p>Of course, the specifics vary according to your company, your target client or customer base, market conditions and your competition. Your company’s specific sales pitch should naturally adjust as well, with targeted messages to different segments of your present customer or client base, and another message for prospective customers or clients.</p>
<p>Marketing costs, and the resources to cover those costs also vary depending on whether your company is well established in the market or entering a crowded set of competitors. Social media has leveled the playing field somewhat. A single viral post can put a company on the map for little or no money. Nonetheless, very rarely can social media stand alone as a marketing strategy. Even so, a small company often has limited resources to devote to a marketing or advertising campaign. A <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/business-loans">business loan</a> can provide an important boost to marketing efforts.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Would Someone Choose to Buy from You in General?</strong></h2>
<p>The key to a successful sales pitch is conveying how your company and its products and services are both <strong>distinct from and superior to</strong> those of your competitors. For instance, in a highly competitive market you may find it necessary to compete on price, or at least demonstrate exceptional value for money if you can’t (or choose not to) compete strictly on price. In a high-end market, you may emphasize your company’s upscale features, either in luxury-grade materials, exceptional workmanship, outstanding customer service or some combination of the three. A 100 percent satisfaction guarantee also helps to transform prospects into customers.</p>
<p>However, many of today’s consumers, especially those among younger demographics, also demand more than just great products or services. Demonstrating corporate responsibility through transparency in company policies and community outreach enhances your company’s credibility with thoughtful consumers and clients.</p>
<h2><strong>Sales Pitch 101: What&#8217;s Your Business&#8217; Official Sales Pitch?</strong></h2>
<p>Unless you are a natural salesperson, you may hesitate to engage in a full-scale sales pitch. However, cultivating new customers and clients — and maintaining them — is essential to remaining in business.</p>
<p>Once you’ve developed a prospect list, you should create a qualifying script to determine whether a given individual has the authority and budget to purchase your products or contract for your services.</p>
<p>Once a particular target has been qualified as a prospect, the actual sales pitch should be conducted less as a hard sell and more like an open-ended conversation. Having a set of talking points is helpful, but you don’t want to sound like you’re reading from a prepared script. Instead, pay attention to clues such as “we’ve been thinking about this type of product” or “that would really address some challenges we’re having.” These represent ripe prospects.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Create an Elevator Pitch?</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, the most well-thought-out sales pitch is useless if you never have a chance to use it. That’s where an elevator pitch can help. An elevator pitch can benefit small business owners and entrepreneurs, not just job seekers. An elevator pitch is a succinct description of your company’s products or services, target customers or clients, factors that distinguish your company from the competition and a call to action.</p>
<p>The hook is the key to an effective elevator pitch. The hook is a catchy one or two sentence statement that summarizes your elevator pitch while commanding the attention of your audience and drawing them into the substance of your elevator pitch. While telling an engaging story is important, there’s no need to strain to be humorous or entertaining. Your goal is for your audience to take you seriously and this requires a careful balance.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Manage Your Prospects and Customers</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve done the hard work of developing prospects and customers, proper management and maintenance is essential. <strong>Relationship building</strong> is the potential “secret sauce” that builds a loyal customer base. Maintain regular contact through promotions and special offers.</p>
<p>However, contacts should not be limited to sales or marketing efforts. If possible, one great strategy for customer relationship maintenance is to establish a blog and send out regular updates. But if maintaining a blog is not feasible, regular email messages containing links to industry-relevant articles is a good substitute. The time required represents one more demand on your probably-limited resources, but the effort will pay dividends in increased sales and revenues.</p>
<h2>Making the Sale</h2>
<p>Your company’s value proposition represents a valuable foundation for your marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. Your elevator speech, sales pitch and any marketing efforts should focus on why your company’s products or services would be better at filling your customers’ or clients’ needs than your competitors. While social media can help raise your company’s profile, especially with younger demographics, counting on “going viral” isn’t a viable marketing strategy. While conventional marketing and advertising can be prohibitively expensive for a small business or solo entrepreneur, a business loan can help level the marketing playing field.

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are probably familiar with the saying “time is money,” but you may not really understand how true it is. Studies show that the average executive wastes an hour of work time each day looking for missing information. The Small Business Administration reports that many small businesses cannot properly serve their customers because of disorganized paperwork.</p>
<p>By contrast, an organization that is both efficient and effective is an organization that delivers the goods and services its customers want and need in a timely fashion and at prices they are willing to pay. The time, effort and money spent maintaining well-organized operations are a good investment in the profitability of your company.</p>
<h3>Disorganization Can Be Costly</h3>
<p>As a small business owner, time is often at a premium. You may recognize the value of being organized but believe that you’re just too busy keeping your business running to devote the time necessary to getting organized. However, this sort of thinking fails to take into account the costs that your business is likely suffering due to lack of organization.</p>
<p>According to a 2011 Hiring Trends survey conducted by Express Employment Professionals, management level employees lose as much as nine work hours each week because of excess clutter on their desks or in their offices. Translated into dollars <span class="fr-style">—</span> this means that a manager earning $50,000 annually costs the company more than $11,000 each year due to disorganization. That’s hardly pocket change.</p>
<p>Disorganization can lead to lost revenue in other areas. Lost files or equipment must be replaced. Cash flow is often critical in small businesses. Disorganized records often lead to delayed invoicing, and resulting delays in receiving payments.</p>
<p>Disorganization also has a negative impact on current or potential clients. Rightly or wrongly, clients perceive disorganized operations as being unprepared to handle their business. Your company’s finished product may be spectacular, but you may never have the opportunity to demonstrate that excellence if would-be customers perceive your company as unprofessional.</p>
<h3><strong>Keeping Crucial Documents and Files Organized and Accessible</strong></h3>
<p>An essential element to the smooth operation of your business is ensuring that crucial records are readily accessible. Such records include current contracts, banking information and financial reports. The key to maintaining ready access to crucial records is creating an efficient categorization and filing system. Bear in mind that many documents can be scanned into electronic files to reduce paperwork and for easier transmission among employees and clients alike. The IRS accepts scanned documents, including receipts, for tax filing purposes.</p>
<p>The specifics of your company’s filing system will of course be unique to your business circumstances. However, there are several features common to most effective organization and filing systems <span class="fr-style">—</span> both paper-based and electronic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform filing procedures – alphabetical, chronological, geographical, etc.</li>
<li>Controlled access – either by physical security or electronic password</li>
<li>Clear, logical categories, including cross-referencing of files and documents as necessary</li>
<li>Expandable and flexible to accommodate changing conditions</li>
<li>Systematic purging of obsolete records</li>
</ul>
<p>One frequently-overlooked aspect of records organization associated with hard copies is establishing a means of keeping track of files in use. The absence of such a system often leads to “missing” files that often turn out to be on top of someone’s desk. One option for keeping track of files in use for a paper filing system is to post a sign-up sheet by the filing cabinet or other storage area that lists the file being used along with the name of the person using the file.</p>
<h3>Employing the KISS Principle for Efficient Operations</h3>
<p>While retaining crucial records is important, unnecessary duplication of records and the resulting clutter represent significant hurdles for efficient operations. Employing the KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Samuel or Susan) can make a significant impact on helping your business run more smoothly.</p>
<p>You may hesitate to undergo a purging process due to an understandable fear of discarding documents that are actually important or necessary. The following list provides a good guideline for which documents should be retained, along with how long they should be retained. Specific questions pertaining to document retention should be addressed to your company’s accounting department or a certified public accountant:</p>
<ul>
<li>General income tax returns &#8211; three years from date of filing or two years from date of payment, whichever is longer</li>
<li>Employment tax records &#8211; four years after tax is due or paid, whichever is later</li>
<li>Deduction for bad debts or worthless securities &#8211; seven years</li>
<li>Business assets &#8211; until period of limitations expires after disposal of the property</li>
<li>Business ledgers, annual reports and similar documents &#8211; indefinitely</li>
<li>Invoices, accounts payable, expense reports &#8211; seven years</li>
<li>Cancelled checks &#8211; seven years</li>
<li>Bank account and credit card statements &#8211; seven years for annual statements, one year for monthly statements</li>
<li>Documents for potential or ongoing litigation &#8211; consult your company’s attorney(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Human resources files are among the most important for every business besides solo proprietorships. The recommended retention rate varies according to the type of file involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee files &#8211; seven years after resignation or termination</li>
<li>Files for job applicants not hired &#8211; three years minimum</li>
<li>Workers compensation files &#8211; four years after case conclusion</li>
<li>Benefit, pension, profit sharing records &#8211; indefinitely</li>
</ul>
<h3>Organization as a Sales and Marketing Tool</h3>
<p>It should be apparent that there is significant intrinsic value for your company to get organized and stay organized. However, organization can be both a sales tool and a marketing tool for your company as well. The key is to communicate the value for money benefits provided to your customers due to your company’s efficient and effective organization. An annual email or blog post allows you to outline specific achievements <span class="fr-style">—</span> such as rapid response time to customer requests <span class="fr-style">—</span> that remind your customers of why you deserve their business.</p>

<p>The year has just begun and making sure you did everything you could last year to optimize your small business taxes is a good way to start the year.  The last few weeks were filled with holiday parties, family get-togethers and holiday gift shopping, but hopefully you left just enough room for some 2019 preparations. As a small business owner, you know not to neglect the job of planning for the upcoming tax season,  but you should make it a priority to address the five tax-related tasks listed below.</p>
<h3>1. Identify Applicable Tax Law Changes</h3>
<p>While each year produces a fresh set of tax code changes, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) passed in 2017 and fully implemented in 2018 represents one of the biggest changes in the federal income tax code in decades. A full analysis of the extensive changes associated with TCJA that affect your specific business deserves a serious discussion with your accountant. However, there are two major changes that especially impact small business owners: Qualified Business Income Deductions and Meals and Entertainment Deductions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualified Business Income Deduction &#8211; </strong>Qualified entrepreneurs and companies, including sole proprietors and S-corporations, that report pass-through business income can now claim a 20 percent business income deduction. However, single business owners must have taxable income below $157,500 to qualify for the full deduction; the limit for married business owners filing jointly is $315,000. To further complicate matters, what the IRS designates as “specified service trades or businesses,” including physicians and attorneys, are ineligible for the deduction in their taxable income exceeds $207,500 if single or $415,000 if married filing jointly.</li>
<li><strong>Meals and Entertainment Deductions &#8211;</strong> Under the former tax code, business owners and entrepreneurs were able to deduct 50 percent of meals and 50 percent of the face value of business-related entertainment events. However, TCJA has eliminated the events deduction while leaving the deduction for meals intact. In other words, if you treat a client to box seats for a local sporting event, that expense is no longer deductible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your accountant or tax professional can provide more info on these and other changes in the federal tax code. One important caveat for business owners and entrepreneurs is that on August 8, 2018, the IRS pulled the plug on so-called crack-and-pack maneuvers utilized by business owners to take advantage of the Qualified Business Income Deduction.</p>
<p>For instance, before August 8, a law or medical practice whose income would otherwise be too large to qualify might attempt to spin off different divisions such as bill collection or administrative functions into separate entities that would have incomes low enough to qualify for the deduction. Such maneuvers will no longer fly with the IRS.  If your accountant or tax professional suggests a crack-and-pack maneuver, find someone else to prepare your taxes.</p>
<p>While TCJA is the tax-related elephant in the room for 2018 and beyond, other tax federal, state or municipal law changes may also impact your business operations. It’s worth setting an appointment with your accountant or tax professional to sort everything out.</p>
<h3>2. Weigh Advantages and Drawbacks of Deferred Income</h3>
<p>Under federal tax law, income received on or before December 31 is included in the present tax year. If you anticipated that this year’s income will be significantly lower than last year’s income, it may have been worthwhile to defer December payments and accounts receivable until after January 1 to lower your income for this year. This is why we suggest staying in touch with your accountant or tax professional all year round.</p>
<h3>3. Maximize Business-Related Tax Breaks</h3>
<p>Failure to take advantage of all the tax breaks to which you are legally entitled is leaving money on the table, a practice which few business owners or entrepreneurs can afford.  Easily missed deductions include purchases of business-related books, magazines, in-kind charitable deductions and purchases of office supplies. Just be sure to retain your receipts.  If you’re unsure about whether you qualify for a given deduction or credit, err on the side of caution. Collect and retain any receipts or documentation, and present them to your accountant or tax preparer. He or she should be able to make a determination.</p>
<h3>4. Analyze Accelerated Depreciation Options</h3>
<p>TCJA also instituted significant changes to allowable depreciation allowances beginning in 2018. Section 179 allowances for equipment purchased and placed into service during 2018 increased from $510,000 to a cool $1 million. Heavy SUVs, trucks and vans with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of more than 6,000 pounds that are used more than 50 percent for business that were placed into service during 2018 now qualify for a 100-percent bonus deduction. Likewise, qualifying new and used business-related assets placed into service during 2018 also qualify for a 100-percent bonus deduction. Like nearly ever other aspect of the tax code, this section of TCJA includes complex caveats. Unless you are a trained certified public accountant or tax attorney, you should not attempt to navigate accelerated depreciation on your own.</p>
<h3>5. Obtain a Second Opinion to Identify Missed Deductions</h3>
<p>Tax regulations are complex. Even diligent entrepreneurs and business owners are almost certain to miss important deductions or tax breaks. It is definitely worth the money to have a CPA or tax attorney look over your financial documents, including tax returns, to determine if you are eligible for additional tax breaks, or if one or more items present potential additional tax obligations. Consider it an investment that could spare you endless headaches down the road <span class="fr-style">—</span> not to mention potentially save you thousands of dollars.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans are notorious about leaving vacation days on the table. According to a 2018 article posted on the CNBC web portal, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/3-reasons-americans-wont-take-a-vacation-this-summer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of 1,000 survey respondents</a> polled by Bankrate did not plan to take a summer vacation. While half of those respondents cited lack of money, 22 percent claimed they could not take time off from work. It’s true that after returning from a relaxing vacation, returning to a high-stress work environment and a mountain of work can be a shock to the system. You may even feel like you need another vacation to recover.</p>
<p>If taking additional time off isn’t viable, that doesn’t leave you without options. The five strategies listed below can protect your mental health during the transition from vacation mode to the everyday work routine and beat the post-vacation blues.</p>
<h3><strong>Ease Back into the Routine</strong></h3>
<p>It’s unrealistic to expect to hit the ground running immediately after returning from a vacation. Instead, ease back into the routine while paving the way toward getting back into gear. If possible, come in a day before your planned return to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/harmoncullinan/2017/06/29/three-strategies-to-avoid-the-post-vacation-blues/#3d520edd1948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort through unread emails</a> and written materials. Divide them into two categories: “To Do” and “To Wait” so that you’ll know what to address first once you make your official return to work.</p>
<p>Refrain from overfilling your work calendar for the first few days after coming back. Especially avoid the temptation of jumping into a series of meetings right away. Instead, block off time in your calendar to meet individually with key colleagues — especially those who have covered for you while you were away. You should also set aside time to return phone calls, respond to emails and correspondence in your “To Do” category and catch up on other urgent matters.</p>
<h3><strong>Take Breaks Throughout the Day</strong></h3>
<p>One of the purposes of a vacation is to relax, distress and recharge. It’s natural that your mind will still be in vacation mode when you first return to work. Rather than dismiss this mindset, utilize it during scheduled meditation breaks throughout the day. According to an article in Psychology Today, imagining yourself in a location where you experienced enjoyment yields <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-tapas/201003/post-vacation-blues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beneficial neurological effects</a>.</p>
<p>Meditation does not have to be elaborate. You don’t have to sit cross-legged on your office floor and chant if you would feel awkward doing so. It’s sufficient to lean back in your chair and close your eyes for a few moments. If possible, leave your work area entirely and step outside for sunshine and fresh air.</p>
<p>Your colleagues may be curious about your vacation, and you may have dozens, if not hundreds of great photos and memories. Why not share a few with your colleagues — perhaps at lunch or briefly before scheduled meetings. Unless you and your coworkers are completely under the gun, this is a great way to extend the enjoyment of your vacation for a few days longer.</p>
<h3><strong>Anticipate Future Time Off</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you love what you do, taking breaks is essential. One way of ensuring that vacations are a viable option is by planning ahead. According to “The State of American Vacation 2017,” a report produced by Project Time Off, <a href="https://projecttimeoff.com/reports/the-state-of-american-vacation-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent of workers</a> who actively plan their vacations actually wind up taking all their allotted time off — versus just 40 percent of non-planners.</p>
<p>The first days of returning from your vacation represent an ideal time to plan your next period of time off from work. Even if you can’t pull off another full-fledged getaway right away, the anticipation of a long weekend a few weeks or months down the road can be enough to get you through those long, tedious meetings or endless piles of paperwork. You’ll be amazed by the benefits to your mental health.</p>
<h3><strong>Incorporate Your Vacation into Everyday Existence</strong></h3>
<p>Post-vacation letdown can give you a case of the blues. Especially if your time off was spent in an exciting or exotic location, your everyday existence can seem humdrum in comparison. Why not incorporate some of the aspects of your vacation into your regular routine? If you enjoyed eating delicious foods from another cuisine, include some of those items on your next grocery trip. These days, many grocery stores include extensive ethnic food sections. You may even have specialty stores in your location. Other commodities, such as clothing, writing papers, magazines and music can add a touch of vacation variety into your everyday life.</p>
<h3><strong>Recharge with Family and Friends</strong></h3>
<p>Numerous research studies have shown that prolonged isolation tends to feed depression. While you may be too busy at work to resume a regular social calendar right away after returning from vacation, avoid the tendency to get bogged down with work for weeks and months after your return. Instead, surround yourself with family and friends by scheduling fun activities or simply to decompress from the pressures of your work.</p>
<p>Your budget may be stretched thin after taking time off. Nonetheless, it’s important to make plans for fun during evenings or regular weekends, such as get-togethers with friends. Nothing elaborate or costly is necessary — a potluck dinner or an evening watching a DVD is an inexpensive way to reconnect with the important people in your life.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Back!</strong></h3>
<p>Planning for the time after your return from vacation can avoid the pitfalls of the post-vacation blues. Doing so can help preserve the benefits of rest, relocation and time away from work, and help you be more productive once you return.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As colder weather approaches, individuals and companies alike begin thinking about and planning for the holidays. If you’re among the many business owners who plan to celebrate the holidays with your employees, you’re in good company. You’re also engaging in a smart business practice. As it turns out, celebrating the festive season not only increases good will around the office or factory floor, doing so is good for the company’s bottom line.</p>
<h3>Workplace Satisfaction and Job Performance</h3>
<p>As a businessperson, you may recognize value in keeping your workers happy. Employee turnover is expensive, not to mention disruptive. However, maintaining employee satisfaction also helps your company’s bottom line in boosting productivity. In fact, studies cited by the Harvard Business Review showed that companies experienced <a href="https://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/examining-the-relationship-between-workplace-satisfaction-and-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31 percent more productivity</a> and 37 percent higher sales when employees were happy or satisfied.</p>
<h3>Why Holiday Entertainment Spending Pays Off</h3>
<p>At the height of the Great Recession, many companies cancelled so-called extras such as holiday bonuses and parties. In fact, only <a href="https://www.omaha.com/money/at-least-some-company-holiday-parties-make-a-comeback-after/article_f5713b5c-cdff-5f65-bc57-f009b80c345c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent of companies</a> responding to an annual survey conducted by Challenger, Gray and Christmas in 2011 planned to hold holiday parties. By 2015, the number of companies that planned to host holiday festivities had rebounded to 80 percent.</p>
<p>There’s a good reason for the upswing. Holiday entertainment spending demonstrates that the hard work and effort employees put in is appreciated. The money spent on holiday parties, bonuses and gifts can be viewed as an investment in maintaining stability among your company’s workforce. Workers who feel appreciated are more willing to put in extra effort when needed and less likely to be shopping around their résumés to look for new jobs.</p>
<h3>Best Practices for Spending the Holiday Budget</h3>
<p>There are five major elements of any get-together: guest list, venue, food and drink, ambiance and entertainment. Many big companies splash out on big-ticket celebrations during the holidays, including celebrity entertainment, all-expense-paid getaways to exotic locations or lavish feasts featuring dancing accompanied by live music and open bars.</p>
<p>However, it is not necessary to break the bank to throw an enjoyable holiday party. If your budget is limited, you can either opt to cut back expenses overall, or limit some areas while splashing out on others. For instance, holding the holiday celebration on company premises incurs few or no additional expenses. However, logistics may be a challenge if your company is large or you plan to host spouses, vendors and others along with your employees.</p>
<p>The guest list for a holiday party is often determined by the nature of the celebration. In-house lunches are often limited to employees, while employees often expect to be allowed to bring spouses to evening events held over dinner. Adding vendors and other non-employees to the guest list also increases costs.</p>
<p>The tab for food and drink for a holiday celebration can be as inexpensive as a potluck lunch or as extravagant as an all-expenses paid, multi-course sit-down dinner along with an open bar and a live band for dancing. Entertainment for holiday parties can also translate into major expense. As a rule, live entertainment is more expensive than pre-recorded tracks spun by a deejay. Ambiance and lighting are often neglected. Fortunately, creating an inviting ambiance is often as simple (and inexpensive) as strategic lighting and well-placed, unobtrusive speakers.</p>
<p>If you intend to serve alcohol at your holiday party, it’s smart to minimize the risk of partygoers driving home while intoxicated. Reserving a block of hotel rooms is a generous option, especially for parties held off premises. Complementary rides home by cab or shared-ride service is a somewhat less expensive option that accomplishes the same purpose.</p>
<p>If your holiday party budget is more generous, an evening celebration where spouses are invited and which features live entertainment and a sit-down meal may be viewed as more memorable by employees. On the other hand, a limited budget does not mean limiting the fun of a holiday party. A catered lunch allows a welcome opportunity for downtime and camaraderie among employees, and between workers and supervisors.</p>
<p>Invitations represent one aspect of a holiday party that involves little or no cost. Online sites such as Evite allow hosts to create secure, private sites for their celebrations, with customized invitations distributed via email or text, and running tabs of acceptances and regrets.</p>
<h3>In-Office Versus Offsite Parties</h3>
<p>In-office parties are often more convenient, especially for lunchtime celebrations <span class="fr-style">—</span> after all, your workers are already there. Parties on company premises also tend to be less formal and more relaxed, which often suits the culture of smaller companies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many larger companies opt to host their holiday festivities offsite, especially if alcohol is served. Many offsite venues include provide food and drink, covering two aspects of your company’s holiday celebration. Offsite celebrations signal that the get-together is social, rather than an extension of the workday, and lend themselves to more formal celebrations.</p>
<p>Informal holiday celebrations provide opportunities for employees at all levels to relate to one another in a relaxed atmosphere. Secret Santa exchanges with preset spending limits or outings to see a popular family-friendly movie are fun ideas for smaller companies. Planning a date to serve meals in a soup kitchen honors the spirit of the season while providing a means for companies of all sizes to give back to others who are less fortunate.</p>
<h3>Tax Implications of the Holiday Party</h3>
<p>While the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated several formerly-allowed entertainment-related tax breaks, some deductions for company holiday parties were left intact. Specifically, hiring a popular entertainer for an evening to entertain vendors is probably no longer eligible for a tax break. However, expenses for parties held for employees and spouses (except for “highly compensated employees”) likely remain 100 percent tax deductible.</p>

			<p>Goal Setting for Small Business is a big deal. Understanding where you are and where you want to go sets up your business for short- and long-term success. In this article we'll go over 5 points to keep in mind when setting your goals for the future.</p><ol><li class="p1">Lack of Goals and Hindered Growth</li><li class="p1">Creating Work-Life Balance</li><li class="p1">Setting Attainable Goals</li><li class="p1">Prioritizing Goals</li><li class="p1">The Trap of Goal Setting</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>Founding Father Ben Franklin has been credited with the statement “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!” The truth of this statement is especially evident in relation to goal setting for small businesses. However, it&#8217;s also important to set attainable goals to ensure that they become <em>actual</em> achievements. It is equally important to understand when and how to prioritize goals when it’s impossible to accomplish everything right away.</p>
<h3>Lack of Goals and Hindered Growth</h3>
<p>The human brain is wired to solve challenges and work through obstacles. Tangible goals allow the brain to work at its optimal capacity, and achieving goals provides a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Likewise, employees perform better when they understand what is expected of them. Goals provide concrete direction for employees to pursue.</p>
<p>By contrast, an absence of goals often translates to a lack of direction, even in the most passionate entrepreneurs. There may be a flurry of activity, but not much actually gets accomplished. Employees may become frustrated because they don’t know what management wants <span class="fr-style">—</span> or they get the impression that their efforts don’t meet some unstated standard.</p>
<h3>Creating Work-Life Balance</h3>
<p>Especially when a business or entrepreneurial venture is in launch phase, goals often focus on profit and material gain. That’s understandable, and it can be satisfying to finally be able to make payroll or be able to meet all of your company’s invoices for the month if you’ve been struggling to cover start-up costs, or worse, you’ve been hit with an unexpected expense that threatens to blow up your entire enterprise. However, focusing only on money and profit-related goals often leads to burnout and ultimate failure.</p>
<p>Instead, strive to set a balance between work-related goals and the other areas of life, including family, friends, partners and enjoyable hobbies or pastimes. The optimal work-life balance varies from person to person and may even change over time. That’s OK. What’s important is that the goals you set for your work and your life are fulfilling and satisfying for you.</p>
<h3>Setting Attainable Goals</h3>
<p>There is much to be said in favor of aiming high in setting goals for your business or entrepreneurial enterprise. In their book <em>Built to Last</em>, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras wrote about the merits of setting “Big, Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAG)”. Setting such aspirational goals often inspires extraordinary achievement. One such BHAG was stated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 when he challenged America to aspire to sending astronauts to the moon and returning them safely to Earth before the end of the decade. Although he did not live to see it, his BHAG became a reality when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon on July 20, 1969 <span class="fr-style">—</span> and his capsule indeed returned safely to Earth.</p>
<p>However, there is a danger in setting unattainable goals. One risk is burnout. Another hazard is the risk that frustration will set in and eventually lead to lethargy. Instead, business goals should strive to be viable and SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely. (Not to be confused with OnDeck&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/looking-small-business-loan-look-transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMART Box</a>)</p>
<p>The best goals are specific, realistic and potentially achievable. It’s not enough to say “I want my business to turn a profit.” Instead, set an attainable goal, such as “I want to increase my company’s revenues by X percent by midyear,” where X is a realistically attainable figure based on past performance and the capacity of your company and its resources.</p>
<p>You should also provide some tangible measure to determine whether your efforts are effective. For instance, a measurable goal would be to strive for a year-on-year increase in revenues from the first quarter of the previous year to the first quarter of the present year.</p>
<p>Finally, goals should be timely. Set a reasonable time frame for achieving your ultimate goal. For many goals, one year is a reasonable time frame. However, it’s also wise to set incremental time frames, for instance, quarterly or monthly. Determine what reasonable progress toward the ultimate goal would look like at each incremental time frame. Doing so serves two purposes. First, it’s easier to remain on track and second, viewing progress at interval goals provides tangible evidence that progress is indeed being made, which reduces frustration.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Goals</h3>
<p>In many small businesses, everyone is expected to wear multiple hats. There is often an “all hands on deck” atmosphere that can be exhilarating. However, when people are expected to pursue too many goals, the unfortunate outcome is that people become focused on “checking off” items on a goal list rather than actual accomplishments.</p>
<p>A smarter course of action is to acknowledge that, while it may be desirable to achieve every goal, it is often unrealistic to expect that they can or should be pursued at once. Instead, it’s essential to prioritize certain goals for immediate attention while scheduling others for a later date. Do not confuse prioritizing goals with procrastination, which often occurs as a result of feeling overwhelmed by the impossibility of accomplishing all of a specific set of goals.</p>
<h3>The Trap of Goal Setting</h3>
<p>As essential as the process of goal setting is, it’s important to remember that setting goals is not a magic bullet. Otherwise, the danger exists that goal setting becomes an end unto itself. Even the most worthwhile goals represent just the beginning of the process <span class="fr-style">—</span> execution is still necessary in realizing those goals.</p>
