			<p><em>Article Summary:</em> The most important part of building and maintaining a healthy FICO score is to stay current on your mortgage, any auto loans, credit cards, or other personal debt you may have. Nevertheless, managing delinquencies is possible to minimize the damage of an occasional late payment. The following four considerations will help:</p><ol><li><strong>Exceeding 60 days past due is treated differently than exceeding 30 days past due</strong></li><li><strong>You FICO score will start improving the moment you bring your account(s) current</strong></li><li><strong>The number of delinquent accounts matter</strong></li><li><strong>Delinquencies typically fall off your personal credit report after seven years</strong></li></ol><p>Keep reading to learn more.</p>		</div>
		
<p>Although your personal credit score doesn’t represent your business creditworthiness, it will likely be part of how most small business lenders evaluate your business loan application. With that in mind, small business owners need to not only make sure they take actions to build a strong FICO score, they also need to be careful not to unintentionally do anything that will lower their score.</p>
<p>Here’s a little “inside baseball” that will help you avoid inadvertently doing something that will negatively impact your score.</p>
<h2><strong>Managing Delinquencies</strong></h2>
<p>Because so much of your FICO score is dependent upon how current you are with your debt obligations, it probably goes without saying that you need to keep on top of your mortgage, auto loans, credit cards, and other personal debt. However here are four things you should know that will help you better manage delinquencies and minimize the damage when you are delinquent.</p>
<p><strong>Exceeding 60 days past due is treated differently than exceeding 30 days past due—</strong>If circumstances require you to miss a payment, don’t miss the second payment.</p>
<p><strong>You FICO score will start improving the moment you bring your account(s) current—</strong>Don’t think that because you have a delinquent account you should throw in the towel or that it’s too late to save your credit score. Remember:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The score is measuring “the time since last delinquency” in months</strong>, so bringing the account current quickly will start improving your score.</li>
<li><strong>Delinquencies impact your score less and less as time passes</strong> after you bring the account current; minor delinquencies don’t hurt you much after a couple of years.</li>
<li><strong>The number of delinquent accounts matter—</strong>If you can contain delinquency to one account, it will help minimize the damage to your FICO score.</li>
<li><strong>Delinquencies typically fall off your personal credit report after seven years—</strong>Nevertheless, charge-offs and certain types of bankruptcies can stay on for 10 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the best case scenario is to avoid delinquencies all together, but that can sometimes be difficult. If you do have to make a late payment, hopefully this advice will help you manage the damage to your FICO score today, so it doesn’t severely impact your score down the road.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><em>Article Summary:</em> Although there are many reasons why small businesses borrow capital, the costs associated with borrowing should be considered to determine when small business borrowing makes sense for your business.</p><p>Categorizing your business needs into three groups and asking these three questions will help you determine if leveraging a small business loan makes sense:</p><ol><li>Will borrowing help me improve the profitability of my business or provide increased ROI?</li><li>Will borrowing help me improve the value of my business?</li><li>Is there an operational need that needs to be addressed right away to keep my business running?</li></ol><p>Keep reading to learn more.</p>		</div>
		
<p>Admittedly there are numerous and varied reasons why small businesses borrow. In many instances, borrowed capital can be the fuel that propels growth and keeps small businesses moving forward. Growing up in a small business and having spent nearly 40 years of my career either as an employee of a small business or a business owner myself, I’ve discovered that some reasons for borrowing are more beneficial to the business than others.</p>
<p>If your business has a healthy cash flow and the revenues to support debt, borrowing can be an invaluable tool to help your business leverage opportunities to grow and thrive. With that in mind, I group (at least what I consider) good reasons to borrow into three categories which will help you determine if borrowing is a good idea for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Category Number 1: To Increase Profits</strong></p>
<p>Of all the reasons to borrow this is at the top of my list because any tool that has the potential to add profits or additional ROI shouldn’t be ignored. In fact, many of the most successful small businesses I’ve observed over the years have leveraged small business debt to fuel growth within their respective businesses by increasing ROI. They also look at borrowing differently than those businesses that seem to struggle with debt.</p>
<p>They consider the total costs of borrowing (interest rates, fees, etc.) as part of the cost of goods sold. Looking at it this way helps them determine if the costs of borrowing will make the product or service their offering more profitable or will add too much to the cost of doing business. Here are a few examples of when <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/is-financing-business-growth-a-good-idea-for-my-business">small business borrowing to fuel grow</a>—or increase profit or ROI could make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your business has an opportunity to purchase quick-turnaround inventory at a discount:</strong> It’s not uncommon for suppliers to offer discounts on special purchase inventory or annual bulk purchases of inventory a business could quickly turn around to make additional profit. Every additional five or 10 percent you can earn on business you’re already doing is additional ROI added to the bottom line making an <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/loantype-inventory-loans">inventory loan</a> a viable option.</li>
<li><strong>You want to purchase equipment that will generate additional income:</strong> For example, a restaurant owner may decide the addition of a new pizza oven could add additional revenue to his or her business. The same could be true for a contractor who determines a new backhoe or front-end loader would give him or her the ability to add an extra crew and generate more income. If this describes your business need, an <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/loantype-equipment-financing-and-leasing">equipment loan</a> could be a good option.</li>
<li><strong>You’re considering a new marketing campaign to increase your business’ footprint in the market: </strong>P.T. Barnum famously once said, “With out promotion something terrible happens. Nothing.” Many small businesses reach a point where they determine they need to do some marketing. Maybe it’s a direct mail campaign or a series of adds on local radio or some other marketing idea designed to bring more customers into their business generating additional revenue and profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the few times my father thought borrowing made sense was when there was a reasonable assumption that doing so would somehow increase profits. He considered borrowing for anything that didn’t increase profits to be too expensive, so that was always a litmus test for him. I tend to agree that this is one of the best reasons for borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Category Number 2: To Increase Business Value</strong></p>
<p>Increasing the value of your small business is a little different than improving the ROI of a particular product or initiative. These initiatives will likely be longer-term investments than purchasing inventory or equipment, but can also be good reasons to consider borrowing. A couple examples of borrowing with this objective in mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A need to expand into a new location:</strong> Small business owners generally understand the important role growth plays to the long-term viability of their businesses. If growth includes the need to expand into an additional location to better serve your customers or to increase your position in the market, this could be a good reason to seek small business financing (provided your business has the ability to service the additional debt).</li>
<li><strong>Your business needs more space:</strong> Whether your business needs to expand into a larger warehouse to accommodate more inventory or is a restaurant with a goal to add an outdoor dining area to accommodate customers who want to take a meal outside, this type of investment in your business could be another good reason to seek borrowed capital.</li>
<li><strong>Your business’ physical facilities need an update:</strong> If you’ve been in business for a few years and the exterior of your building, the machinery you use (if you’re a manufacturer), or your HVAC needs to be updated, these investments not only increase the value of your business, but they are also potentially good reasons to consider borrowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For some businesses, making investments like these are more important than they might be for others, but asking yourself, before you borrow, if the funds will improve the value of your business is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Category Number 3: To Keep Operations Running</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the unforeseen happens. When a critical piece of equipment needs to be repaired or replaced, it’s often not practical to wait for cash flow to become available to make repairs or replace the failed equipment. These types of expenses, whether unforeseen or anticipated, could be good reasons for some kind of <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/loantype-temporary-cash-flow-loans">temporary cash flow loan</a>, and could look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A business-critical piece of equipment needs to be repaired or replaced:</strong> This would equally apply to a restaurant’s pizza oven as it would to the milling machine in a machine shop or small manufacturer. When the opportunity costs of a down piece of equipment exceed the costs associated with borrowing to fix or replace, borrowing could make sense.</li>
<li><strong>Plumbing, HVAC, or other Utility Issues Arise:</strong> I’ve personally felt the sting of a plumbing line failure in an older building that required a contractor to dig up the parking lot to the street to make repairs. Expense? Yes. A good reason to borrow or access a credit line? Yes, again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional capital, or small business borrowing, isn’t the answer to every challenge a business owner faces, but in the right circumstances can be a great tool to help your business grow and thrive. I admit, my views on this topic are conservative. There are costs associated with borrowing, regardless of how low or high the interest rate might be, and those costs can’t be ignored. To insure that borrowed capital benefits your business, rather than weigh it down, ask yourself these three questions before  you apply for a loan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will borrowing help me improve the profitability of my business or provide increased ROI?</li>
<li>Will borrowing help me improve the value of my business?</li>
<li>Is there an operational need that needs to be addressed right away to keep my business running?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to these questions will help you determine if the reasons you are considering a small business loan make sense and will help your business grow and thrive.</p>

			<p><em>Article Summary:</em> Are you prepared for your business loan application? In addition to the documents you'll need to apply for a small business loan, there are some other things you'll want to do before you start looking for a loan.</p><p>The more information you have at your fingertips, like your P&amp;L, an overview of your expenses, and your annual revenues, the better you'll be able to discuss your business' financial health with a potential lender. Although the document requirements will vary from lender to lender, keep reading to learn more about some of the common documents and other things you'll want to do to prepare for a small business loan.</p>		</div>
		
<p>In addition to the local bank, there are more options available today than ever before for small business owners who need to borrow extra capital to fuel growth or fund other business initiatives. What lenders require regarding creditworthiness, age of business, revenues, and documentation varies, but there is some basic information you&#8217;ll want to have at your fingertips whenever you apply for a loan.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t think most lenders expect a business owner to be an expert in small business financing, they will want to know that you have an understanding of your businesses financial position. I once spoke with a lender who said, &#8220;If I can tell more from a business&#8217; financial documents than the business owner, I most likely will not approve their loan application.&#8221; With that in mind, let&#8217;s start with a few of the questions most lenders need to answer:</p>
<h2>What Lenders Want to Know</h2>
<p>Most lenders are trying to answer a few fundamental questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can your business repay a loan?</strong> Is your business in a position to service debt? Do you have the revenue and cash flow to make periodic payments? This is why lenders ask questions about your revenue and cash flow. Many lenders will also want access to the previous three months of your bank statement to verify that you have the cash flow to make the periodic payments.</li>
<li><strong>Will your business repay a loan?</strong> What does your business credit profile and personal credit score look like? How long has your business been doing business? Lenders use this data, for example, to look at your track record. If your business can demonstrate a good history of servicing debt in the past, lenders see that as evidence that you will be more likely to do the same in the future.</li>
<li><strong>What will your business do should something unexpected happen?</strong> If you are borrowing to fuel some kind of growth strategy or profit initiative, for example, will you still be able to make the periodic payments regardless of the outcome of those initiatives? This is one reason why traditional lenders like the bank, including SBA-guaranteed loans, will require specific assets be identified as collateral. They want to make sure they will be protected should something unexpected happen.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Documents Often Needed to Apply for a Business Loan</h2>
<p>Although every lender is different and could require different things, the following list is a good place to start. Regardless of whether or not the lender you&#8217;re applying with requires these documents, understanding what the documents are telling you is important information every business owner should be familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your business financial statement</strong>, including a profit and loss (P&amp;L), an income statement, and an outline of your expenses</li>
<li><strong>Your personal financial information</strong>, including the last three years of your personal income tax return</li>
<li><strong>Your business license</strong></li>
<li><strong>A copy of your business lease</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your business bank statements for the last three months</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For most small business owners, personal credit history will be factored into any creditworthiness decisions. What&#8217;s more, traditional lenders like the bank or a credit union will likely require some kind of specifically identified asset to be used as <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/collateral-really-need-business-loan">collateral</a>. Many online lenders won&#8217;t require specific assets to be identified as collateral, but they will likely assess a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/unsecured-business-loans">general lien</a> on business assets and require a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-personal-guarantees">personal guarantee</a> to secure the loan.</p>
<h2>Are You Prepared for Your Business Loan Application</h2>
<p>In addition to the documents you&#8217;ll need, there are a few fundamental things you&#8217;ll want to make sure are in place before you apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have a business credit track record, start <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/build-a-strong-business-credit-profile">building your business credit</a> by creating trade credit relationships with your suppliers or applying for a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-business-credit-cards">business credit card</a>. It may not be a small business loan, but it will help you build a strong business credit foundation; provided your suppliers report to the appropriate business credit bureaus.</li>
<li>Because your personal credit score will be part of the creditworthiness discussion for most small business owners, it&#8217;s important to be aware of your current score and work to improve a less-than-perfect score. For example, a personal credit score below 600 will make it difficult to qualify for a business loan. If there are issues, start taking actions that will help you <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/boost-personal-credit-score">improve your personal credit score</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your business identity is in order. You&#8217;ll need a business tax I.D. number as well as a separate business banking account (this is true even for sole proprietorships). A business phone, address, and even a website will help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;re ready to apply, make sure you can clearly articulate your reason for borrowing (your loan purpose). Of course being prepared is no guarantee that your loan application will be approved, but it will likely increase the number of options you have available.</p>

			<p><em>Article Summary: </em>Answering the question, "Does a business loan make sense for my business?" really requires that you answer a few more questions first.</p><p>With that in mind, here are four questions you should ask before you start looking for a small business loan:</p><ol><li>What do I need to borrow extra capital?</li><li>Will my cash flow support the periodic payments?</li><li>What does my credit profile look like?</li><li>Will borrowing positively impact my bottom line?</li></ol><p>Once you answer these questions, it will be easier to determine whether or not a business loan makes sense for your business.

<p>Popular media would have us believe that the answer to every small business problem can be solved with money—I call it the myth of the Shark Tank. Although access to capital can help business owners resolve a lot of small business challenges, borrowing at the wrong time, or for the wrong reasons, can put profits in jeopardy and potentially put a lot of stress on a business. Answering the question, “Does a business loan make sense for my business?” requires asking and answering a few more.</p>
<h3><strong>Question #1: Why do I need to borrow extra capital?</strong></h3>
<p>This question is really less about the reason and more about whether or not you have a specific specific loan purpose. Asking yourself this question first, will help you determine if the rewards of borrowing are worth the expense and help you determine how much you need to borrow, what kind of term makes sense to meet your business need, and even where to look for a loan. This should always be the first question. If you can’t give yourself a definitive answer of how you’ll use borrowed capital to push your business forward, it might not be a good idea to borrow.</p>
<h3><strong>Question #2: Will your cash flow support the periodic payments?</strong></h3>
<p>Regardless of where you borrow, there are costs associated with a small business loan that will impact your cash flow. Many lenders today offer daily, weekly, or monthly periodic payment options. Depending upon how cash flows through your business, you may need to evaluate your ability to service the debt depending upon the <em>way</em> cash flows through your business. For example, daily or weekly periodic payments are very effective at distributing the cash flow burden across the entire month, but if your cash flow all happens at the end of the month, this type of periodic payment might not be the right choice. Additionally, you’ll also want to consider the average monthly payment obligation, regardless of whether the payments are daily, weekly, or monthly. There are times when a daily repayment frequency can result in a lower average monthly payment obligation compared to a monthly payment.</p>
<h3><strong>Question #3: What does your credit profile look like?</strong></h3>
<p>For most small businesses, the owner’s personal credit, as well as their business credit, will be part of any creditworthiness evaluation. Different lenders have different accepted thresholds when they evaluate a business owner’s personal credit score. Traditional lenders like banks and credit unions will want to see a score of 700 or better (although in some cases they will drop that threshold to 680). The SBA will go as low as 650, and many online lenders will go below that if there are other metrics in place that demonstrate a healthy business and the cash flow to service the debt. Along with other metrics like time in business and annual revenues, your business credit profile and your personal credit score will be part of the equation. Fortunately, if you have a less-than-perfect credit profile, with time and effort, you can <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/easiest-ways-to-strong-business-credit">improve your credit profile</a>—both your personal credit score and your business profile.</p>
<h3><strong>Question #4: Will borrowing positively impact my bottom line?</strong></h3>
<p>There are lots of legitimate reasons for seeking a small business loan. I’m not suggesting the only viable reason is to generate ROI, but that’s a good one. I’m of the opinion that generating additional profits or increasing the value of the business are at the top of the list. If the loan purpose isn’t going to do that, additional consideration should be made because of the cash flow impact.</p>
<p>The answers to these questions will help you determine if a small business loan makes sense for your business. Your answers likely won’t guarantee a loan approval, but could help you improve the odds when talking to a loan officer who is trying to evaluate your loan application, you, and your business compared to the others he or she is currently reviewing.</p>
<p>Does a business loan make sense for your business? You have the answers to that question.</p>

			<p>Article Summary: Comparing the costs of different business loans can be challenging because different lenders can express costs differently. Here are a handful of metrics you should know before you sign on the dotted line:</p><ol><li>Annualized Percentage Rate (APR)</li><li>Total Cost of Capital (TCC)</li><li>Average Monthly Payment Obligation</li><li>Cents on the Dollar</li><li>Prepayment Conditions</li></ol><p>Keep reading to learn more about these five metrics.</p>		</div>
		
<p>Comparing the costs of a short-term loan to a long-term loan or a merchant cash advance to a line of credit or term loan, can be challenging because different lenders can express their costs differently—making it a challenge to make an apples-to-apples comparison. With that in mind, let me share a handful of metrics that will help you when you’re comparing the costs of different business financing.</p>
<p>Because there is no one-size-fits-all way to describe every potential financing option available, here are some metrics you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Annualized Percentage Rate (APR)</strong></p>
<p>The APR metric is a good way to compare loans with similar terms. It was introduced to help consumers make decisions about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and other consumer credit. Commercial lending, small business lending, is a little different. Because of the different ways businesses access funding, APR is one of the metrics you might compare, but it certainly isn’t the only metric.</p>
<p>APR is not the interest rate on a loan or used to calculate the total dollar cost of any financing, but is rather an annualized percentage rate that expresses the interest rate along with any fees associated with any small business financing.</p>
<p><strong>Total Cost of Capital (TCC)</strong></p>
<p>This metric will include all interest and any other fees that are a condition of receiving capital. The Total Cost of Capital metric discloses the total dollar cost of the financing option, a crucial source of information for a small business borrowing for a use case that includes a defined ROI.</p>
<p><strong>The Average Monthly Payment Obligation</strong></p>
<p>Not to be confused with “monthly payment” the Average Monthly Payment Obligation metric identifies the average monthly cash flow impact of repaying the financing option being considered, regardless of whether the periodic payment is daily, weekly or monthly. The average monthly payment obligation provides a common benchmark for evaluating monthly cost.</p>
<p><strong>Cents on the Dollar</strong></p>
<p>The Cents on the Dollar metric identifies the amount of interest (or loan fees, as applicable) paid for every dollar borrowed. This metric is exclusive of all other fees to allow for comparison with other common pricing metrics in commercial finance, including the factor rate, simple interest, and total interest percentage.</p>
<p><strong>Prepayment Conditions</strong></p>
<p>You should also be asking about whether or not there will be additional fees or charges for prepayment and what they may be. It also identifies if prepayment will result in any reduction in interest or applicable loan fees. Asking this will make any applicable prepayment policy readily transparent.</p>
<p>Transparency into these metrics will help you make an informed decision based on your use case and the costs associated with borrowing. These metrics are included in the SMART Box<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Disclosure (a supplemental disclosure used by some lenders), but regardless of whether or not your lender uses the SMART Box, I think it makes sense to ask these questions before you sign on the dotted line.</p>
<p><strong>Different Use Cases Could Require Different Financing</strong></p>
<p>Although you don’t need to become a small business financing expert to find the right loan for your business, if you arm yourself with these metrics, it will be easier to determine which type of financing will best meet your business need and will help you understand any potential ROI of any financing you may be considering.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e7e7e7;">
			<p>Article Summary: Organization does a lot of good things for a business.

<p>Keeping your business organized is just as important as keeping customers and employees happy. Every small detail about your business matters because everything is ultimately connected, so having a system for keeping things in their rightful place can help your team&#8217;s overall productivity and boost revenue. But you might be wondering if you can simply fix what you see that &#8220;needs fixing&#8221; or whether you need to take a more complete approach to setting organizational goals for your company.</p>
<p>Taking a &#8220;do what needs to be done&#8221; approach is like going into a boxing match blindfolded against a heavyweight champion and expecting to come out unscathed. It&#8217;s highly unlikely. The same goes for this type of approach to getting your company organized. If you want results that last and to create a highly productive working environment, you need to create a detailed plan that can help your organization run more efficiently. We&#8217;ll get into the best ways to do that, but first, let&#8217;s see how getting organized can improve employee satisfaction and business performance.</p>
<h3>1. Increased Efficiency.</h3>
<p>If your team can easily find what they need to do their jobs, they can improve overall efficiency because they won&#8217;t waste precious time searching for something that should have a rightful place &#8211; and be easily accessible (like in most workplaces). For example, a secretary or receptionist would be a lot more efficient if you had a designated place for everything they needed to use, like a supply closet filled with office supplies in labeled drawers and shelves. A label maker can make office organization a breeze along with<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/21-tips-to-organize-your-office-and-get-more-done.html"> bins and baskets</a> for varied office supplies like pens, paper clips, staples, ink, paper, and other supplies.</p>
<h3>2. Increased Revenue.</h3>
<p>As you&#8217;ve likely heard, time is money. And if your employees have to spend more time performing their daily duties because of disorganization, your company is losing money.</p>
<p>With improved organization comes a boost in revenue because when you know where things are and you have a system in place for performing certain tasks, or handling certain issues, your team can be faster and handle issues quicker and with better resolution; and therefore, serve more customers. The more customers you can serve, the more money you can make.</p>
<h3>3. Reduced Employee Burnout.</h3>
<p>If your employees become too overwhelmed with &#8220;organized chaos,&#8221; you may just start losing them. Organized chaos is still chaos. So find ways to keep an organized workplace because employees won&#8217;t stick around to work for a company with no sense of a structured and organized operation. And you don&#8217;t want your company to become known as a &#8220;revolving door,&#8221; a nice way to say, “A place no one can stand to work at for too long.”</p>
<h3>4. Improved Customer Service.</h3>
<p>Improved organization can help your employees better serve customers and prospects. For example, when you give your customer service team a set of guidelines to follow when dealing with customers and organize that information into a packet or binder, they&#8217;ll be much more effective in delivering high-quality customer service. They&#8217;ll know what to expect on the job as well as what to do in the event that a customer has a common issue. You might also include instructions on what to do if an issue arises that isn&#8217;t covered in the packet. Adding a table of contents or even digitizing the information to be accessed online can improve customer service and overall productivity even more. Many companies are employing what&#8217;s called a <a target="_blank" href="https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/knowledge-base">knowledge base</a> to answer general questions and address common issues. It&#8217;s similar to an FAQ section, but it&#8217;s more detailed and the information is organized by topic instead of on one scrollable page.</p>
<h3>5. More Opportunity for Growth.</h3>
<p>With a more organized workplace, your teams can thrive and truly enable your company to grow. Because with improved efficiency, increased revenue, reduced employee burnout, and improved customer service, your team will be in the prime position to see amazing growth. When all of the parts of a machine run smoothly, the whole thing operates at optimum performance. So if you want to see your company soar to new heights, consider developing a comprehensive plan to get your company organized and on track to see the growth it should.</p>
<h3>How to Improve Overall Organization</h3>
<p>If you want your company to benefit from the above suggestions, you&#8217;ll need to approach organization like a mechanic rather than a maid, meaning you need to organize your tools to maximize working efficiency (like a mechanic would) rather than just trying to clean things up in general, or tidying up (like a maid would). Start from the inside out and be methodical about your approach. Create a  list of areas that need organization and then start brainstorming ways to improve those areas with policies, processes, or anything else you need to use to make your workplace run more smoothly.</p>
<p>Also remember, the type of organizing affects the approach (financial, computer files, office configuration, etc.) so don&#8217;t take a one-size-fits-all approach to getting your company organized properly. Take some time and really think about the best approach for your employees and for each area. Try to make organization a part of your daily routine. For example, make organizing part of keeping financial records instead of treating them like two separate tasks.</p>
<h4>Organization as a Sales Tool and Marketing Tool</h4>
<p>When determining what your organizational goals should be, include your entire team in the discussion. After all, it&#8217;ll directly affect their working conditions and they may have some great ideas to improve sales or marketing efforts. So use organization as a sales and marketing tool by employing practices and using modern technology to help you organize different areas of your company improve your sales team and marketing team performance. For example, you could find and employ a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inc.com/sujan-patel/10-tools-to-streamline-your-sales-process.html">customer relationship management (CRM) system</a>, which can help you improve the overall customer experience, as well as keep your employees organized and satisfied with the high level of organization a software program like this can provide. You can even use the CRM to host your knowledge base.</p>
<p>A highly organized company is more poised for success than a company with no formal structure or system in place to handle the daily complexities or running a business. Organization is key to being more productive and bringing in more revenue as your company begins to see growth. Not to mention it can keep your employees sane and prevent them from running for the door. So find ways to keep your workplace organized and efficient if you ever want to see real growth.</p>

			<p><em>Article Summary:</em> Multi-tasking seems to a highly-valued and prized skill in business today.

<p>Over the more than 35 years of my career, I’ve frequently seen both, “Must be good at multi-tasking” on job descriptions and “I’m a great multi-tasker” on resumes—neither of which portends a good or productive employee. In reality, nobody is good at multi-tasking.</p>
<p>Nancy K. Napier Ph.D. writes in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/creativity-without-borders/201405/the-myth-multitasking">Psychology today</a>, “Much recent neuroscience tells us that the brain doesn’t really do tasks simultaneously, as we thought (hoped) it might. In fact, we just switch tasks quickly. Each time we move from hearing music to writing a text or talking to someone, there is a stop/start process that goes on in the brain.”</p>
<p>In other words, the idea of being an effective multi-tasker, or the effectiveness of multi-tasking, is a myth—our brains just aren’t wired to do more than one thing at a time. There are those, who can switch from task to task relatively quickly, but that is not the most productive way to go about a workday. Although we can do two things at the same time, like watching a television program while cooking dinner, our brains cannot concentrate on two things at the same time. We are either distracted by the one, or ignore the other.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/email-multitasking-study.pdf">2003 study</a> published by the International Journal of Information Management reported that the average person checks their email once every five or so minutes—creating a distraction from the task at hand—adding that it takes about 64 seconds for your brain to reconnect with what you were doing before the interruption.</p>
<p>If you’re a M.A.S.H. television show fan, you might remember an episode where Hawkeye and Trapper were giving Major Charles Emerson Winchester III a hard time after one of his first shifts in surgery. They were suggesting that he was slow, to which Winchester quipped, “I do one thing at a time. I do it very well. And, then I move on to the next.”</p>
<p>This might not be the best way to impress your fellow meatball surgeons at the 4077 M.A.S.H., but it is the best way to be productive at work. Doing more “things” does not drive better results, doing one thing at a time, the best you can do it, will drive the best results—looking busy and being productive are two different things.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Be That Person</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been in a restaurant with someone who is regularly checking their smart phone, you&#8217;ve witnessed for yourself how multi-tasking doesn&#8217;t work. Not only does it feel like they aren’t engaged in the conversation you’re having with them—they aren’t. The same is true if you’re having a conversation with a colleague at work and they have their laptop open checking email, or the driver in front of you weaving around the lane because they are talking on the phone (which is why the National Transportation Safety Board reports that texting while driving is equivalent to driving with a blood-alcohol level that is three times the legal limit).</p>
<p>What’s more, Susan Weinschenk, Ph.D. suggests <a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201209/the-true-cost-multi-tasking">The True Cost of Mulit-Tasking</a> could be a productivity loss of 40 percent. She suggests that task switching is expensive:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes more time to get tasks completed if you switch between them than if you do them one at a time.</li>
<li>You make more errors when you switch than if you do one task at a time.</li>
<li>If the tasks are complex, then these time and error penalties increase.</li>
<li>Each task switch might waste only 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a second, but if you do a lot of switching in a day it can add up to a loss of 40 percent of your productivity.</li>
<li>Task switching involves several parts of your brain: Brain scans during task switching show activity in four major areas: the pre-frontal cortex is involved in shifting and focusing your attention, and selecting which task to do when. The posterior parietal lobe activates rules for each task you switch to, the anterior cingulate gyrus monitors errors, and the pre-motor cortex is preparing for you to move in some way.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve ever heard anyone ever say, “The busier I am the behinder I get,” they probably think multi-tasking works.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on Only One Thing at a Time</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Weinschenck argues, “For many years the psychology research has shown that people can only attend to one task at a time. Let me be even more specific. The research shows that people can attend to only one cognitive task at a time. You can only be thinking about one thing at a time. You can only be conducting one mental activity at a time. So you can be talking or you can be reading. You can be reading or you can be typing. You can be listening or you can be reading. One thing at time.”</p>
<p>While it is possible to switch back and forth from one thing to another fairly quickly—you should measure the cost of doing so.</p>
<p>I remember as a kid of sometimes being accused of an inability to walk and chew gum at the same time. And, while it is possible to do a repetitive physical activity like walking and a cognitive activity like talking at the same time, Dr. Weinschenk also cited a 2009 study that demonstrated people talking on their cell phones while walking, ran into people more often and didn’t notice what was going on around them. “The researchers had someone in a clown suit ride a unicycle,” she wrote. “The people talking on the cell phone were much less likely to notice or remember the clown.”</p>
<p>It looks like Major Winchester was on to something. Do one thing at a time. Do it well. And, then move on to the next thing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p>Article Summary: How business owners borrow capital to fuel growth and build their businesses has changed a lot in the last few years. The introduction of new small business lending technology is making more capital available to more businesses.</p><p>Here are six technologies that have changed the way small businesses borrow:</p><ol><li><strong>The Internet:</strong> Like everything else we do, the Internet has impacted the way small businesses access borrowed capital</li><li><strong>Online Applications:</strong> In addition to being online, the simple and straightforward application process makes it much easier for a busy business owner to apply for a business loan</li><li><strong>Big Data:</strong> Access to more information about the health of your business make it easier for small business lenders to evaluate your business' creditworthiness</li><li><strong>An Online Connection to Your Bank:</strong> This connection makes it easier for both you and your bank to review critical information to evaluate your business' financial health</li><li><strong>ACH Transactions:</strong> By enabling a direct debit from your business checking account, it makes it easier for you to make timely payments as well as allowing the lender to collect each and every periodic payment</li><li><strong>Mobile Banking:</strong> By minimizing the need to physically go to the bank to review account balances, access funds, or even start a loan application, technology is making it more convenient to apply and manage a small business loan.</li></ol><p>Keep reading to learn more about what technology has done to the small business loan process.</p>		</div>
		
<p>I’m convinced there are more options available than ever before for small businesses looking for borrowed capital. What’s more, I think it’s small business lending technology that has made it much easier for lenders to evaluate creditworthiness, create loan options to meet the varying needs of small businesses, and business owners to apply and access capital.</p>
<p>The traditional way banks have worked with small business owners had been basically unchanged for the last 100 years. Online alternatives to the traditional bank have introduced a better way to evaluate loan applications and rethink the small business lending process in a way that benefits both business owners who rely on capital to fuel business growth and fund other profit-building initiatives, and the lenders who supply that capital.</p>
<p>Some of the small business lending technology that allows lenders to make more capital available to more small businesses include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Internet:</strong> The Internet has changed the way we do just about everything from shopping for shoes, to finding a mechanic, and even finding a small business loan. A small business owner need no longer go from bank to bank looking for a potential lender—the options are readily available online from traditional banks, the SBA’s Loan Guarantee Program, online lenders (like OnDeck), and several other alternatives to a small business loan that help make capital available to small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>An Online Application:</strong> Putting a small business loan application online is only part of the technology, making that online application simple is the real benefit to a small business owner. Instead of wading through 30 or 40 pages of loan application documents, a streamlined application that can be accessed in the privacy of your place of business, allows a business owner to quickly complete an application (often within a few minutes) and find out within a day or two whether or not they might be approved for a business loan. This process would often take weeks—or even months, without the technology that allows the lender to quickly review an application and make a decision.</li>
<li><strong>Big Data:</strong> By big data, I’m referring to all the information that is publicly available about your business. Business lenders today can leverage a lot more information about how your business compares to other business in your industry, in your region, and of your size, when it makes credit decisions about your business.</li>
<li><strong>An Online Connection to Your Bank:</strong> The ability for a lender to access your business banking records make it easier and faster for a lender to evaluate your cash flow and ability to make the periodic payments required to service business debt. This connection makes it easier for a lender to evaluate and potentially say, “Yes,” today that might have said, “No,” just a few years ago.</li>
<li><strong>ACH Transactions:</strong> An ACH debit from your business bank account allows a lender to seamlessly accept payments from your business as well as making it easier for your business to make those payments.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Banking:</strong> Many people today are able to view their personal account balances, make transfers from one account to another (from a personal savings account to a personal checking account for example), and even make deposits. Many small business lenders today make it possible for a business owner to start a loan application on their smart phone, manage a business line of credit, and review their loan balances via their smart phones.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, all this small business lending technology doesn’t eliminate, or even mitigate, all the fundamental business credit best practices a lender uses when evaluating your business creditworthiness, but it does make it easier to see the entire picture of a healthy business while considering business metrics that demonstrate the health of your business, and your business’ ability to service debt, beyond what the bank might have considered before the introduction of this technology. That being said, technology shouldn’t replace the need for a skilled loan officer to review your business loan application, but it does enable them to see more information, streamline the review process, and make more borrowed capital available to healthy small businesses.</p>

<p>Most of the time when we talk about the need to prepare your business for the unexpected, we wind up talking about setting money aside to meet a business’ monetary demands during a slow season or to meet <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/temporary-cash-flow-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial needs of a crisis</a>. There is no doubt, setting aside some capital for a rainy day is a good idea—nevertheless, that’s not the topic for today.</p>
<p>When the unexpected happens, because many small business owners <em>aren’t</em> general contractors, electricians, plumbers, or mechanics it’s important to be prepared to take care of a minor crisis to keep your business functioning, even if a professional will be needed in the end.</p>
<h3><strong>The Unexpected is Never Convenient</strong></h3>
<p>I don’t know why plumbing problems always seem to happen in the winter in the same way the air conditioning always seems to crap out on the hottest day of the year, but it usually seemed to work out that way. I worked out of a hundred-year-old building, that started its life as a home, for just about 20 years, so we faced all the challenges you might face with plumbing and electrical that were well past their prime. Regardless of whether your business is situated in an old building or a brand new building, here are seven things you can do to prepare your business for the unexpected.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep a functioning tool box at the ready:</strong> Most businesses don’t need to maintain a shop to keep things going, but a tool box with the appropriate set of sockets, screwdrivers, adjustable wrenches, a pair of pliers, and a hammer come in handy at surprising regularity. I consider a tool box cheap insurance.</li>
<li><strong>Your bathroom needs a plunger, a mop, a bucket, and maybe a wet-dry vac:</strong> Toilets tend to overflow and sinks tend to leak, so in addition to your tool box, you’ll need the cleaning supplies to clean up after a mess. If you’re restroom floors are tile or linoleum, you’ll be able to get by with a mop and bucket, but if you have carpet in there (like we did) you might need a wet-dry vac to clean up after a plumbing problem.</li>
<li><strong>You might also need a pair of rubber boots:</strong> A customer once flushed something down the toilet they shouldn’t have and caused our relic of a toilet to overflow (unnoticed overnight) flooding the basement and requiring me to wade ankle-deep in water to install the sump pump and clean out the unfinished basement that was our storage area. I didn’t have a pair of rubber boots at the time, but I wished I had.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a list of rental yards at the ready:</strong> A list of places where you can rent a sump pump or other tools that you only need in case of emergency is a good idea. The last thing you want to do is spend an hour trying to figure out where to find what you need when you’re up to your neck in an emergency.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t let the snow slow you down:</strong> If you do business someplace where it snows, you likely have someone who plows the parking lot so your customers can get to your place of business. Every fall the guy who plowed our parking lot would reach out to us to confirm we wanted our lot plowed—until he didn’t, causing a scramble the first big snow that hit us that year. In other words, in addition to a shovel or snow blower to keep your sidewalks clean, don’t forget to make arrangements for the lot to be plowed. Even if you do business out of a strip mall or other location where snow maintenance is part of your rent, make sure you have at least a snow shovel for those days when the maintenance crew is slow to get to your place of business (some snow melt is also a good idea).</li>
<li><strong>The value of a quiet fan or two can’t be underestimated:</strong> Although it’s not idea, your customers and your employees will thank you when the power goes out if you have a nice quiet fan or two to keep the air circulating if your air conditioner craps out.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a list of preferred contractors to fix major pluming issues, electrical issues, heating or air conditioning problems, or fix a leaky roof:</strong> I’ve found that waiting until you need emergency help is not the best time to be looking for someone to get your business out of a lurch. I found this to be incredibly important working out of a 100-year-old building.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>An Ounce of Prevention</strong></h3>
<p>I shamefacedly admit that at home I’m not as diligent at changing my furnace filters or inspecting the state of the plumbing in my bathroom, but it was a lot easier to catch potential problems early at the business, so I could take care of them before they failed, to avoid inconvenience to my customers and employees.</p>
<p>And, don’t forget the unexpected is … unexpected. One night vandals went down the road shooting out windows (including our display window). The building alarm noticed, so an early-morning trip to Home Depot was needed to put a big sheet of plywood up before the glass company could come and replace the glass. Even if you’re <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/prepared-for-disaster-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepared for most emergencies</a>, there will be one or two that slip through the cracks, but you can prepare your business for the unexpected by being ready to deal with the aftermath.</p>
