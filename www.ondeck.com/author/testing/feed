								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small business owners live to see their businesses thrive. Fantastic earnings are one thing, but hearing the compliments of satisfied customers and collaborators brings validation to atrepreneur; it&#8217;s rewarding to know that you&#8217;re doing something right – and doing it well.</p>
<p>Here are five of the best compliments to hear as a business owner:</p>
<p><strong>From vendors: &#8220;You&#8217;re our favorite customer!&#8221;</strong><br />
When your vendors proclaim that they love doing business with you, you know you’re on the right track – perhaps even to a better deal on their products or services.</p>
<p><strong>From employees: &#8220;I actually like coming to work.&#8221;</strong><br />
All small business owners have spent time dealing with disgruntled, lazy or unmotivated employees &#8211; it just comes with the territory. So it’s refreshing when your staffers tell you they find their work rewarding and the workplace inviting.</p>
<p><strong>From customers: &#8220;You&#8217;re saving my life!&#8221;</strong><br />
Enthusiastic customers are key to a successful business. Solid products and services create strong advocates for your brand, and it&#8217;s great to hear that your business is having an impact.</p>
<p><strong>From investors: &#8220;We want to put more money into your business.&#8221;</strong><br />
What business owner wouldn&#8217;t want to hear that their investors want to increase the amount of money they&#8217;re putting in? That speaks volumes to their confidence in the business&#8217;s success.</p>
<p><strong>From family members: &#8220;You&#8217;ve been spending more time at home lately.&#8221;</strong><br />
Ensuring that your business is successful and your employees and constituents are happy is crucial, but so is making sure you’re spending time with family. A positive work-life balance means your business is stable and successful enough to function without you from time to time.</p>
