								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;"><strong>Understanding your business credit profile</strong></span></h3>
<p>A key measure of your business’ financial health is your business credit profile. We want you to get the most from your OnDeck relationship by helping you understand and manage your business’ credit profile.</p>
<p>Since the credit profile describes how your business interacts with your creditors including online lenders, loan payments to OnDeck help tell one part of that story. A positive payment history is the single biggest impact on your business credit profile over time, potentially improving your business’ profile and lowering your perceived credit risk.</p>
<p><strong>If you’d like to learn more about business credit, please visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-business-credit">OnDeck Education Center</a></span></strong>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;"><strong>Accessing your business credit report</strong></span></h3>
<p>We report information about your business’ term loan payment status to three nationwide business credit bureaus every month: Experian, Equifax, and Paynet.[1] For Line of Credit customers, we currently report to Experian on a monthly basis. Items reported include payment amounts, outstanding balance, past due payments, and other account activity.</p>
<p><strong>This is important because your prompt payments and good credit history with OnDeck will reflect positively on your business credit profile.</strong></p>
<p>You have the option of accessing your business’ report directly from the bureaus—either on a one-time or on-going basis depending on your needs (procuring reports from one bureau may be sufficient). This is an important step to ensure your business credit profile is an accurate representation of your business credit behavior. Regularly monitoring your profile is recommended.</p>
<p>While you have the right to a free personal credit report once every 12 months, a fee is typically charged for business credit reports. Your most recent report should typically be available to you by the middle of the current month for the previous month (e.g., May report is available mid-June).</p>
<p><span style="color: #0074ff;"><strong>To access your report, visit:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Experian (Term Loan and Line of Credit):</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.experian.com/small-business/business-credit-reports.jsp">http://www.experian.com/small-business/business-credit-reports.jsp</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Equifax (Term Loan only):</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.equifax.com/business/business-credit-monitor-small-business">http://www.equifax.com/business/business-credit-monitor-small-business</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Paynet (Term Loan only):</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.paynetonline.com/issues-and-solutions/all-paynet-products/credit-history-report/">http://www.paynetonline.com/issues-and-solutions/all-paynet-products/credit-history-report/</a></span></p>
<p>We also provide Monthly Statements for your term loan, which reflect your principal and interest payments. You can find statements in your OnDeck online account in the “Documents” tab.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;"><strong>Reviewing your business credit report </strong></span></h3>
<p>Your loan with OnDeck is represented as a “tradeline” of credit on your business credit report. When reviewing the report, however, our tradeline won’t be displayed as “OnDeck.” This is because the bureaus do not specify the names of lenders on business credit reports for privacy reasons, unlike on consumer credit reports.</p>
<p>There are some similarities in the way each bureau displays information, as well as some differences. You might see variations in layout, naming conventions, and even level of account detail provided. For example, although we report loan payment amounts to all three bureaus, only Paynet displays the actual payment amount while Experian and Equifax display loan balance. All bureaus indicate whether or not payments are past due or delinquent.</p>
<p>The best way to identify your OnDeck tradeline is to find your current balance with us and match it to the “balance” or “outstanding balance” listed in the tradeline. You can find your current OnDeck term loan balance in the Monthly Statement or your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://online.ondeck.com/login">OnDeck online account</a></strong></span>. For lines of credit, you can find your current balance on the home page of the online account.</p>
<p>Once you’ve accessed your report and identified the current/outstanding balance, you can review our guide below on how to decipher your report details, along with examples of what each bureau’s report looks like.</p>
