								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Tips for Balancing Between Online and In-Person Sales</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>An Interview with Parth Sharma, Brand Breeders</strong></p>
<p>I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to sit down with Parth Sharma, the owner and founder Brand Breeders. Launched in 2011, Parth’s company helps consumer goods brands launch and scale their business. Part manufacturing, part consulting, Parth spends his days looking at customer reviews online and figuring out how Brand Breeders can change and modify different products to bring them to scale.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>For the past five years, Parth and his team have accomplished the following:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully grown revenue by 100% in the last 5 years</li>
<li>Brought over 10,000 new products to market</li>
</ul>
<p>I spoke with Parth about how smart investments in raw materials and inventory have helped him secure these wins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-169594 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-homepage1.jpg?resize=1000%2C513&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brand Breeders Customer Testimonial for OnDeck Blog" width="1000" height="513" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-homepage1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-homepage1.jpg?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-homepage1.jpg?resize=768%2C394&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">Kimberly Solarz for OnDeck:</span> Parth, thanks for taking the time to chat with me. To start, tell me a bit about how you got started. </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth Sharma: </strong></span>My first business that I started was a shirt company back in 2002. We grew very quickly and soon got into most major department stores. Unfortunately, a few years later the economy plummeted, as did the business. Then I pivoted to an online model of business, which I found much less stressful. But, I knew growing online required a different strategy and skill set, so I decided to enter into more categories, and that’s when I officially launched Brand Breeders in 2011. I was doing some consulting, helping other people launch brands, and then soon I started cranking out my own brand. Soon I had my own brand of ties, kids clothing, doormats, etc. And, I haven’t looked back since! And, I haven’t had a single group not been profitable.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> What has been the biggest challenging in scaling your business, and how did you overcome that challenge? </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>The biggest challenge by far is access to capital. I can only grow the business as fast as the capital I have on hand will allow me to. I have to pay for inventory before I even get it. Then I ship it out, and then I have to wait to get paid. If I sell through Amazon or Groupon, I have to wait 60 days to get paid. Cash flow conversion is by far my biggest challenge.</p>
<p>However, I do I think I’ve done a good job of keeping my cycle time down. But still, the cash cycle of an inventory business requires you to have to put money down before you see anything. It can be limiting.</p>
<p>A few things I always try to do: I keep my overhead super low. It’s zero – I pay a little bit of liability, website hosting, etc. I don’t sit on inventory – I’m always cranking through it. I also pad in a good margin. These are all things everyone in the manufacturing business should be doing. On top of that, there is borrowing. Working with OnDeck helped us finance adding in new products into our overall mix, which has been excellent for business.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-169595 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-page1.jpg?resize=1000%2C541&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brand Breeders Customer Testimonial for OnDeck Blog" width="1000" height="541" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-page1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-page1.jpg?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Aug-10-brandbreeders-page1.jpg?resize=768%2C415&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> When do you think it makes sense to finance purchases like inventory or equipment, or do you try to use cash flow to buy what you need? Are there some types of manufacturing equipment or inventory that’s easier to finance than others?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>I think you should finance these types of purchases yourself as long as you can just to make sure you don’t make any critical mistakes. But once you’ve figured out your formula for success, and you know that X dollars can lead to Y revenue, then you absolutely should start borrowing money to grow faster. It’s very slow process to grow if you’re only self-financing. Business owners also need to understand what the economics or dynamics first – you know what your winners are before you seek financing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> What’s your philosophy when it comes to investment in equipment or inventory? What are some of your key do’s and don’ts? </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>I don’t like to buy a product that is a replica or copy of a product that already exists. I read a lot of negative reviews so I can tweak products that are already out there to make them better. I’m not in the business of seeing an item that is selling well and try to put my name on it. You want to stay away from a “me too” product because then you are only competing on price. You have to have something that is either unique, the lowest price or the best product.</p>
<p>For example, my doormats do really well. We make funny doormats. There needs to be a “cool factor.” Something that makes it different and interesting.</p>
<p><em>For my do’s: </em></p>
<p>– Make sure your margins are healthy. You want to at least double your money. It’s not worth it if you can’t.</p>
<p><em>For my don’ts: </em></p>
<p>– Don’t buy anything that is super seasonal too early or too late – it will just sit in a warehouse. You want always to be able to move inventory.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> You’ve had a lot of success in balancing between online and brick and mortar sales. What have you learned from this experience? </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>With a brick and mortar business, there is plenty of room to make money. But it’s a challenge and a real pain – you have to deal with the buyers. It takes a lot of time and effort – they all want net 30 or net 60 terms, but a lot of times their credit scores don’t merit those terms. It can be tricky to manage.</p>
<p>I sell online more – if I can put my product online and then buyers can come to me. I tend to be much more choosy with brick and mortar clients. I don’t proactively reach out brick and mortars to sell them. Your vetting process needs to be different for the two channels. I used to more aggressive with stores, and it can be really taxing on your mind. It leads to a lot of one and done transactions, and that that just isn’t scalable in the long run.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAf92T74FSY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> What advice do you have for other manufacturers who are looking to break into online sales, or even have more of a balance between the two areas? </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>Make something cool and awesome and reasonably priced. Don’t try to be the lowest priced guy and undercut someone else. You need to find something that sells well and then go after that.</p>
<p>And don’t stick to any one marketplaces – there are many aside from Amazon that is less competitive. Diversify your approach in where you are selling.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> What role has access to capital played in your ability to grow your business? </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>Access to capital is critical for any business, but especially a business like mine where inventory turnaround is critical. OnDeck has been an excellent partner, and I’d recommend them to any business owner reading this and looking for ways to grow their business.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">KS:</span> Where do you see your business five or 10 years from now? What’s your plan to get there?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #83eece"><strong>Parth: </strong></span>In addition to continuing to grow the business, I want to start mentoring other aspiring business owners. It’s part of my long-term plan and something I’m super passionate about.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>An Interview with RT Custer, Co-Founder of Vortic Watch Company</strong></h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to the owner and co-founder of Vortic Watch Company, RT Custer. Vortic Watch Company is a high-end wristwatch engineering and manufacturing company based in Fort Collins, Colorado. RT and his partner, Tyler Wolfe, started the company while still in college at Pennsylvania State University. The two have long had a passion for classic watchmaking techniques and timepieces and turned that passion into the prestigious and unique manufacturer that Vortic is today. RT and his team <strong>combine the cutting-edge technology of metal 3D printing with gorgeous, antique, American-made pocket watch movements to create bespoke wristwatches</strong>. Every single aspect of their watches – from the leather straps to the technology inside – right here in the US.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Since launching in 2014, RT and team have accomplished the following:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaled the business from making 100 watches per year to making more than 250 watches per year – and they are <strong>on track to quadruple the business in 2017</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Significantly brought down the cost of making their watches</strong> by investing in the right kind of equipment and making smart inventory purchases</li>
<li>Has <strong>hired and trained four employees</strong>, with plans to onboard more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>RT Custer, Founder of Vortic Watch Company:</strong> We started Vortic when I was still in college. My business partner, Tyler and I came up with the idea while we were on the golf course!  He wanted to make a fully American-made wristwatch using some of the technology I was studying in college. We spent a lot of time talking through the concept and how we would approach it. We then put it on Kickstarter and raised $40,000 to buy our first 3-D printer and our initial inventory.</p>

<h3><strong>Very interesting that you started on Kickstarter. What did you learn from this experience, and would you recommend it to other manufacturers? </strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-160381"><img class="alignleft wp-image-160381" style="float: left;margin: 5px 15px 10px 0" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="RT Vortic Watch Company - OnDeck Small Business Loans" width="50" height="50" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2728&amp;ssl=1 2728w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong>Kickstarter, and crowdfunding in general, is what you make of it. Just because you have a great idea and put it out there doesn’t mean anyone will see it. It’s like having the best website ever, but if you don’t drive traffic or promote it on Google or FB, there is a chance no one will see it. So, Kickstarter became this amazing platform where we could drive all our friends and family, and then their friends and family members, to promote our idea. <strong>What I learned from the experience is that it’s not Kickstarter that it made us successful, it was our story and connections and marketing strategy that made it successful.</strong></p>
<p>In terms of recommending Kickstarter to others, for those in the consumer products space, there are a lot of financing options now. You have Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc. The whole crowdfunding industry has boomed, so I would recommend trying it.</p>
<p>But again, you must do it right and approach it as a campaign and not expect the platform to do all the work for you. It’s a great thing to do as part of a funding portfolio, but not the only way to get money.</p>

<p>Cash flow is the simplest answer. Obviously, we have a fun business, and our product is great to make, and we have excellent reviews. But, our sales cycle is very slow due to the price point. To keep my cost of goods at a manageable level, I need to order hundreds of parts. I’m then restoring hundreds of components of the watches which is very, very slow. The lead times for all my components are very long. <strong>Managing my whole supply chain is complicated and the root cause of my cash flow challenges</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ve had so many ideas on how to make the process and products better that sometimes when that new idea gets implemented, and you start making money from it, it’s almost 6 – 9 months later. We sold &#8220;Version 1&#8221; of our product for almost 18 months, even though we started developing version 2 within our first 6 months. It took us over a year to develop.</p>
<p>In terms of managing the production process, <strong>having access to capital is key</strong>. We’ve raised equity-based financing to get cash in the bank and came to OnDeck for additional capital. We also took pre-orders, where customers paid 50% up front which was super helpful for cash flow. It’s how we survived through the holiday season. It’s a great idea in concept, but you must have an amazing sales team to make that strategy work.</p>

<h3><strong>When do you think it makes sense to finance purchases like inventory or equipment, or do you try to use cash flow to buy what you need? Are there some types of manufacturing equipment or inventory that’s easier to finance than others?</strong></h3>

<p>When we came out with “Version 2” of our product, we thought it was as close to final as we could get. We felt strongly about the product and we wanted to invest money into it. We considered our cost of goods sold and we thought if we could buy 500 watches in terms of parts, instead of 100, we would be on the right track for quadrupling our output.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you must think about your economies of scale – with cash flow you can get to one level, but with financing you can get to an entirely new place. This increases your margins, and your cash flow, and ultimately your revenue and profit for your business.</p>

<h3><strong>What’s your philosophy when it comes to investment in equipment or inventory? What are some of your key dos and don’ts? </strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-160381"><img class="alignleft wp-image-160381" style="float: left;margin: 5px 15px 10px 0" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="RT Vortic Watch Company - OnDeck Small Business Loans" width="50" height="50" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2728&amp;ssl=1 2728w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong>The more you <em>can</em> do yourself the more you <em>should</em> do yourself.</strong></p>
<p>In the watch industry, we call that “bringing it in-house.” Rolex is a great example of that – they are completely vertically integrated they make everything themselves. That’s part of their brand and value – it allows you to maintain a phenomenal quality and control the cost of goods to a T. It’s very expensive to get to this point – you must buy every machine, hire and train every person. For Rolex, this is literally billions of dollars’ worth of investments.</p>
<p>My first hire in the company probably should have been a watchmaker, but he was a graphic designer. If I hadn’t of hired him on an entry-level salary, I would have had to pay an outside agency 4x or 5x of what I have paid him. We also hired a web developer to build an online experience where customers can design their own watch on our website. Having him rather than hiring an agency, saved us tens of thousands of dollars. Now we are doing that with manufacturing – with the financing from OnDeck we are buying more equipment, bringing manufacturing in-house and decreasing our overall cost of goods.</p>
<p>My biggest piece of advice is to try to have as much control over the creation process as you can so can control your costs. And if you aren’t technical, you can still be actively involved in the process. Every time I hire a new supplier, I physically sit down with them because I want to understand what they do and know exactly what I’m paying for. This eliminates a lot of questions and confusion, which ultimately reduces costs down the road.</p>

<h3><strong>How do you manage your inventory? Have you made any arrangements with your suppliers, so you don’t have to keep all of your inventory on the shelf?</strong></h3>

We have to hold that inventory ourselves. Thankfully most of our expensive inventory is labor-based. So labor is more expensive than the physical inventory, which saves us a lot in terms of cashflow so long as everything is timed correctly.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to pay your bills on time. Sounds simple, but if you give someone a PO, they make you 500 screws and you get net 30 and then you don’t pay them within that 30 days, they will not make anything for you ever again. You can burn bridges fast.</p>
<p>There was one time I was going to be 2 days late and I called a vendor on day 29 and I told them I needed a few more days. They were astonished that I called and were so thankful that I asked for more time. It helped create trust between us. Integrity matters. We need more people to do that in our industry, especially if we want American manufacturing to thrive.</p>

This is critical – and what will make your customers come back.</p>
<p>That’s why every website promotes their ratings on Facebook and Google. And even beyond social ratings, word of mouth is the most important. I’ve met 80% of my suppliers by sending quotes to some people and they referred me to someone else…it’s a tight industry and your reputation is everything.</p>

I could run my business off simply cash flow, but not without serious planning and perfect timing. Without banks the world would be ok, it would just be really stressful. If I don’t have a funding source, because I’m constantly aware of my inventory levels and running out of inventory, that’s when I don’t sleep.</p>
<p>That’s why companies like OnDeck are so important – they help you build your business credit while removing stressful ups and downs in cashflow which is really helpful for businesses like mine.</p>

We get approached by other brands all the time who want us to make products for them because they’ve seen the quality of our work or they want to build their products here in America like we do. We’ve recently started getting into private-label manufacturing which is both fun and has huge potential.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important and challenging decisions that you can make as a small business owner is how to set your prices. There&#8217;s a lot of work that goes into the number a consumer sees on a tag, or that a client sees from a vendor. Still, pricing doesn’t come down to an exact science. Rather, it involves weighing multiple factors and putting together an accurate picture of what your product is worth, how much it costs you to produce, and how much your customers will pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a breakdown of the most important factors to consider when setting prices for your goods:</span></p>
<p><b>Market research </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can begin to think about attaching a number to your goods or services, it’s crucial that you have a strong understanding of the market they fall into. How similar products are priced, and how well they’re selling at that price, are valuable pieces of information that will show you where your business fits into the market at large. Be sure to take variations into account among your competitors &#8212; does geographic location affect pricing? Does using different materials change the amount customers are willing to pay? No detail is too small when doing your initial research. </span></p>
<p><b>Value </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to knowing what price consumers are currently paying for products like yours, it’s important to know how they value these products. Are they daily necessities? Are services like yours the kind that are earmarked in an annual budget because customers can’t operate without them? Or are they more optional, such as luxury goods or services? The value that your products offer will give you insight into where you lie in the spectrum of the marketplace. </span></p>
<p><b>Cost of goods</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one should set a price for a product without having any idea how much it will cost to produce that product. The goods that you will need, be they cashmere for your sweater business or social media algorithms for your marketing business, will be a recurring cost, and your supply chain will break down without them. Using the market research you’ve compiled, now is the time to combine it with your production costs to get a realistic idea of how much profit you can make on each unit. </span></p>
<p><b>Labor</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor is the other major production cost that can’t be ignored when setting prices. Particularly for service businesses, labor is a fixed cost that will affect your total overhead and increase your production costs. If particularly skilled labor is needed, you’ll want to be sure to factor that into your pricing. </span></p>
<p><b>Additional overhead</b></p>
<p>Running a business involves many additional costs, from rent for your storefront or office to new equipment to heating and cooling your plant during the cold and warm months. These costs all factor into the total cost of production, and so they must be calculated and considered in setting your prices. Otherwise they will cut into profits and throw your business plan out of whack.</p>
<p><b>Distribution</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major cost that no business owner can ignore is distribution. Shipping, drivers, and other means of transporting your product to where it needs to go will be fixed costs that must always be factored into the total cost of production. </span></p>
<p><b>Economies of scale</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to ascertaining your production costs now, you also want to consider the future when setting prices. What will change in your costs as you grow? Will you need to open more plants or offices? What costs can you account for in your strategy, even when you&#8217;re just starting out? Staying ahead of these types of expenses will give you a leg up, even at the beginning when you’re starting from scratch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no perfect way to set prices, but a smart pricing strategy involves knowing what factors to pay attention to, and what information to gather. Follow these criteria in your research, and you’ll be in good shape to set the best possible price for your products. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You work hard, you put in the hours, and now you&#8217;re seeing the effort pay off. When your profits leave you with extra cash in hand, what&#8217;s the best way to spend it? Setting up a proactive savings plan can make extra cash a normal thing for your business. However your coffers fill up, here are several other smart ways to spend your hard-earned dollars. </span></p>
<p><b>Improve Curb Appeal</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much attention lavished on all things digital, it&#8217;s easy to forget the simple, tangible ways you can update your business. When was the last time you refreshed the exterior of your business? A fresh coat of paint, updated signage, and well-designed landscaping send a message of trustworthiness to potential customers. Clean, bright exterior lighting and seasonal plantings may seem like an unimportant details, but </span><a target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/sbc/2012/05/15/give-your-shop-curb-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they have the power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pull those new or hesitant customers in through the door. </span></p>
<p><b>Update Interior and Tools</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updates for the interior of your business are just as important. Aesthetic improvements&#8211;paint, updated displays, improved branding and signage&#8211;help make customers more comfortable in your stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But updates go beyond aesthetics. If your staff is struggling to operate with outdated software, insufficient computers, or a clunky phone system, invest in tools that will allow your business to function optimally. If you&#8217;re not certain which new tool or update matters most, consult your staff. The people doing the work can tell you which tools and updates would most improve the workflow on the floor. </span></p>
<p><b>Add Needed Staff</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing profits usually come from growing demand, and your employees may be struggling to keep up with an increased workload. Consider the key staff positions that need to be added: is it time for another technician or sales person? To pinpoint where more people are needed, look for slow points in the workflow: where do you see bogged-down operations or continual customer service issues? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the positions you need are managerial, you might be able to promote from your current employees and </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.recruiter.com/i/3-ways-to-ensure-your-next-hire-is-your-best-employee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hir</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">e in new staff to fill the now-empty roles. </span></p>
<p><b>Invest in Staff Training</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you&#8217;ve already added the staff you need to keep up with your growing business. If so, it&#8217;s training time. Advanced training not only keeps employees happier and more fulfilled, it also makes your entire business more valuable. After all, your business is built on the intelligence, skill, engagement, and professionalism of your employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General training, such as customer service training and productivity training, can benefit everyone in your business. Specialized training, such as certification in a specific technical skill, increases the services you can offer your customers as well as increasing the value of particular employees and departments. </span></p>
<p><b>Level Up Your Marketing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget-conscious small business owners often hesitate to spend big money on marketing. It&#8217;s an understandable hesitation; with important demands such as salary and inventory, marketing often seems like the lowest priority on the financial list. Now, with cash in hand, take a look at the marketing options that could benefit your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your web presence is a priority; even for traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, customers expect to find key, updated information online. Mobile marketing isn&#8217;t going to go away, either. More and more customers depend on their mobile devices both in the pre-shopping phase, while researching, and while actually shopping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your website is mobile-friendly; that&#8217;s the first step. The second is to invest in a mobile app that will bring more value and accessibility to your customers. Hire a developer or use an app development service such as </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.appmakr.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AppMakr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biznessapps.com/index.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bizness Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get your own branded app up and going. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Struggling to decide how to spend that extra cash is a great problem to have; congratulations on all the hard work that&#8217;s brought you here. As you make strategic choices to invest the money in continued growth for your business, don&#8217;t forget to set up a savings plan. If you save a percentage of profits regularly, you&#8217;ll be dealing with extra cash, which you can invest in your business, on a regular basis. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sign with opening hours is one of the fixtures of a small business storefront. But “open” and “closed” are not quite as black and white as they appear at first, and there are a lot of decisions when it comes to the right times to operate as a small business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should doors swing open and when should they clink shut? Should you extend your hours for the holiday season? These are all questions whose answers can make a big difference for your customers, your employees, and your own quality of life. So how do small businesses go about deciding?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, consider your customers. How old is your target market? What are their typical occupations? Those kinds of realizations can help you decide the right times to operate your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used to be open until 8:30pm instead of 8pm on weeknights,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol “Orange” Schroeder, the founder and co-owner of Orange Tree Imports, a specialty gift shop in Madison, Wisconsin.  It turned out that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“that last half hour wasn’t so busy,” Schrorder said. What people really wanted was a chance to shop on their way home in the evening. “Even just staying open until 7pm so that people could stop on their way home from work was welcome,” she learned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orange Tree extends their time open an extra hour on Sundays between Thanksgiving and Christmas. When eager shoppers want to make progress on their Christmas lists, stores like this often see the benefits of temporarily extending their hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our holiday hours have been set for several years with the added hour on Sunday,” Schroeder said. “R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ealistically, we know that shoppers would like us to be open all the time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for her staff, Schroeder said the extended holiday hours aren’t a bother, as long as there are customers that need assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not hard to get staff to stay the extra hour on Sundays, once they’re there. But since Sundays outside of the holiday season aren’t as busy, especially late in the afternoon, it seems to work well for all concerned to close at 4pm,” Schroeder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alero, a Mexican restaurant in Washington D.C., stays open for long stretches at a time. Since they’re located in a city with plenty of young people, they decided to stay open until 4am, through it meant going through a process to be approved to sell alcohol that late under the Alcoholic Beverage Administration’s Extended Holiday Hours Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s simple: more open time means more time for sales,” said Victor Martinez, the owner. “We benefit in terms of extended hours meaning more sales.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez said that his entire staff benefitted from the extended hours. Waiters get more tips, and salaried workers get extra hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to reconsider which opening hours will let your business reach the fullest potential, go through this list:</span></p>
<p><b>First, look for patterns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When does your store or restaurant seem to get the most traffic? How could you capitalize on that time? For instance, if your store seems really busy around 4:30 but you close at 5pm, consider what kind of sales could take place if you extended your hours until 6:00. Try opening late for a trial period, or one night a week.</span></p>
<p><b>Second, bank on holiday crowds.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Come hell or high water, the holiday season will pretty much always mean more people spending more money. Look at ways you can extend your hours for the season. Ask loyal customers when they’d most like to do their holiday shopping, and cater to them.</span></p>
<p><b>Finally, consider your staff.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If research points to opening during inconvenient hours or on holidays, unavoidable in retail and food service, make the hours spent worth your staff’s while. Make it standard practice to pay time and a half, and do your best to keep the place busy, so salespeople are occupied and waiters can earn tips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding when to open and close your business can be tricky, but at the end of the day, it always comes back to one thing: the customer’s needs. Focus on them, and let the rest fall into place. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth is important for any small business, but what&#8217;s the best way for your business to achieve growth? There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, there are several strategies you can employ; the key to success lies in choosing the strategy that best fits your particular business. </span></p>
<p><b>Focus on a Specific Market Segment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business has hit a plateau, your first thought is probably that you need to find more customers. So you seek to expand by appealing to a larger customer base. However, getting more customer demand isn&#8217;t always about finding more customers, but about becoming more important to the customers who will appreciate you most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you try to appeal to a broader customer base, you risk becoming an average amenity to lots of people, instead of a beloved service or product for fewer. Your business might lose its special sauce, its personality, and, often, the key characteristics that helped you reach success. So, when you grow, keep the segment of your customer market that has been constant in your focus. Develop products and focus on marketing directly to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific appeal and customized solutions lead to increased repeat sales and more loyal, lasting customer relationships. The key with this strategy is to remember that growth doesn&#8217;t necessarily come from a larger number of customers, but from a greater position of importance within a particular segment of customers. </span></p>
<p><b>Create Business Partnerships</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business partnerships are an excellent growth strategy if you&#8217;re ready to expand but have limited funds to invest in growth. A partnership can expand your marketing reach and your customer base, adding resources and capabilities to your business without breaking your budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form strategic partnerships by finding businesses that provide a &#8220;next-step solution&#8221; to what your business offers. Next-step solutions are the services or products your customers would need directly before or after doing business with you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an event management company might partner with a janitorial company to create packages that provide event planning with discounted cleaning services. By working together to create specials and related offers, both companies can gain market reach, new customers, and increase their sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships create an added incentive for customers to purchase, not only due to the increased value of the offers available, but also due to added convenience and trustworthiness created by the partnership. The key to success with this strategy is to clarify the terms of your partnership up front, in writing, so there is no room for squabbles or misunderstandings as you move forward together.  </span></p>
<p><b>Make an Acquisition</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquisitions are best if you&#8217;re looking for significant growth quickly and you have a significant budget to match. Buying a related business or a competitor can send your business into a completely new location or market, expand your specialties, and ultimately increase your profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, acquisitions require a steep investment and won&#8217;t bring you surging profits right away; you&#8217;ll need to spend time and money to rebrand, train staff, set up operations, and work through the inevitable roadblocks. The key to success with this strategy is a realistic, well-funded plan, divided into key phases, for each step of the acquisition process from purchase to profitability.</span></p>
<p><b>Product or Service Expansion </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your small business has growing customer demand it can&#8217;t satisfy, product or service expansion might be the best strategy for growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New products can increase sales by simply providing more for your customers to buy. But do your market research first; poll your customers and test out new products on a small scale, if possible, before you jump into a full inventory commitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can expand your service offers by increasing your service space and staff.  With increased capacity, your business can meet higher customer demand. You can also invest in further training for your staff, so that they are qualified to offer more specialties and higher-level services to your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased inventory or a larger service capacity might mean you need to add on to your current space or move to a larger space, though&#8211;which will cost money. The key to success with this strategy is to do thorough research and create a financial plan for each need along the way. Don&#8217;t assume you know what your customers want, or which option is best; conduct surveys, talk to customers, do market research, write down the costs, and thoroughly weigh all your options before you make a move. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the growth strategy you choose as a phase in the life of your business; it&#8217;s not an all-or-nothing approach. It&#8217;s a step in your success. If you plan each step well, you&#8217;ll keep climbing. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays are fast approaching. Black Friday is almost here, the day when millions of holiday shoppers will stand in line at 4am for deals on flat-screen televisions and the latest smartphone. It can seem intimidating for small businesses and local mom-and-pop shops to stand up to huge department chains with thousands to spend on holiday advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s good news. According to the 2015 Small Business Consumer Pulse Survey by</span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.coxblue.com/survey/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox Blue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many consumers actually want to do their shopping at small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An overwhelming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of consumers support small and medium-sized businesses in their communities by shopping at them at least once a week,” the survey says. In fact, 71 percent of people stated that they think it’s important to buy local.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how can small businesses capitalize on this desire during the holidays?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of Small Business Saturday. Created by American Express, this “shopiday” was founded in 2010 with the goal of encouraging shoppers to consider buying holiday gifts local instead of focusing only on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Many customers will already be motivated to head to a local business instead of a giant retailer. It’s a great opportunity for you to meet new customers and try to turn them into regulars! Use Small Business Saturday as your “Holiday Kick-Off” and host a special sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer homemade baked goods or warm drinks throughout the holidays. It’s a small luxury that customers won’t get at major chains. Christmas cookies and cocoa will be a nice surprise to cold customers popping into your shop, and will help reinforce for them exactly why they so enjoy the “local” atmosphere. Next time they consider where to shop, they’ll think of you and your sweets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to greet people personally. Strike up conversations with neighbors you recognize—if your kids go to the same school, or they go to the same gym as you, it’s a great way to forge a connection and help them remember your store in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to stand out? Give back to a local non-profit in your area, emphasizing that it’s a generous time of year. On the one hand, giving is way to form a business connection; on the other, it also demonstrates to customers that you’re passionate about the community—and, of course, live out the holiday spirit! Host a book drive for the local children’s hospital, or donate 5 to 10 percent of sales to a charity people admire. Plenty of large franchises will give donations to charity, but your store can stand out by donating to somewhere local.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host a holiday party! Most larger stores don’t have the freedom or flexibility to stay open after-hours, but for most small businesses, hours are something that can be changed on a whim. Host a special “late night” sale, complete with Christmas carols playing and a table to make Christmas cards—or another activity that makes sense for your business. At the same time, customers can peruse merchandise. By offering a fun, family-friendly activity, your small business can further cement itself in the community while continuing to showcase your products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most consumers want to shop local, your only job is figuring out how to make the experience fun and convenient. With these tips, your show will be ho-ho-hopping in no time this holiday season. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays are rapidly approaching, and as business owners know, that means holiday cheer—and the potential for increased revenues. </span></p>
<p>Many retailers rake in a high proportion of their revenues during the holiday season. But how can you take an already good holiday cash flow to straight-up great?</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Have the right inventory. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you’re following up on what’s been popular in 2015. What trends in tech or toys had major staying power? Stocking your store with popular items will help customers continue to see it as the place to shop. If a customer asks for an item you don’t have, see if it’s possible to order it in—it shows you’re willing to go the extra mile to make sure your customers have the gifts they need. [Ty&#8211;we could mention getting a loan to cover extra inventory here if you thought that was useful]</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Do a “12 Days of Christmas” promotion. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riffing on the popular poem, offer a special, 12-day email promotion where each day offers a new deal. This can get new customers on your email list, which you can continue to use into the new year. Email marketing is an affordable way to keep you on customers’ minds and will encourage them to check your store out for the gifts they’re looking for.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Upsell as much as you can. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a bed and breakfast, suggest a romantic holiday getaway package instead of a regular room. If you manage a restaurant, offer appetizers and dessert to every patron. If you’re a retailer, offer gift-wrapping or small accessories in addition to their purchase. While you’ve got the customer in front of you, upselling can make a significant difference in your revenue.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Celebrate the holidays on social media.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Festive pictures of twinkling lights are easy “like” magnets. Design creative images to promote sales, instagram your staff in Santa hats, or tweet out pictures of your inventory under a Christmas tree to use holiday cheer to attract new customers. Social media marketing is an incredibly powerful way to attract clientele (</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/5-ways-social-media-can-get-diners-restaurant"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially to restaurants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and making your pages fun and festive can go a long way to helping customers buy from you in real life.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Make sure your website is up-to-date and mobile friendly. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of customers will now browse online before popping into a store to ensure they’re not wasting their time. Put in some hours as soon as you can updating your site with your newest goods and any special holiday sale information, and make sure it looks nice on a mobile phone, since that’s how most people browse the Internet. You can also use your website to offer links to your email list and social media, as well as promote any specials or deals you currently have.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holidays are a fun, festive time—and they can also be fruitful. Incorporate some of these tips and tricks, and you’ll be feeling the cheer that comes from a bountiful holiday season!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting great online reviews can boost your business-owner confidence and, perhaps, bring new customers to your door. But what do you do when a negative Yelp review pops up? Start out by not worrying too much&#8211;this is fixable!&#8211;and then follow these guidelines to handle the unfavorable review. </span></p>
<p><b>Don&#8217;t Panic</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One bad review (or even a few bad reviews) are not going to kill your business. Though online reviews are influential, (around </span><a href="http://searchengineland.com/88-consumers-trust-online-reviews-much-personal-recommendations-195803" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> check reviews, and say that they trust them), not all customers are equally influenced by negative reviews. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers shopping primarily for the lowest price will be </span><a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/8455/volumes/v28/NA-28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more affected by negative reviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while customers who have some familiarity with the business tend to see negative reviews as exaggerated. Additionally, pure Internet-based businesses are far more likely to be negatively affected by an unpleasant review than brick-and-mortar businesses, which are insulated from such comments.</span></p>
<p><b>Examine the Source</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, determine whether the review is from a legitimate customer or from an underhanded competitor. The more local competition you have, the </span><a href="http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2013/11/study-shows-an-increase-in-local-competition-encourages-negative-review-fraud-on-yelp.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely it is that one of your competitors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has taken to writing fake reviews to make you look bad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, you can take action against fake reviews from competitors: flag the review, then respond with a public comment that the review is from a competitor, not a customer. Be courteous and professional; you&#8217;re not interested in a debate, just in calmly showing that the review is illegitimate. At this point, you can contact your competitor and Yelp and ask both of them to take the review down. Yelp will want proof of the reviewer&#8217;s identity. Your competitor may agree to delete the review if you point out that no one will believe it now that you&#8217;ve identified it as false.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For legitimate customer reviews, investigate the situation that caused the negative review. The more you know, the better prepared you will be to respond appropriately. For example, if a customer is angry because a product was defective, offering to replace the product makes sense. If the anger is from poor service or unmet expectations, however, offering a refund might be better. </span></p>
<p><b>Respond Thoughtfully</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two keys when responding to a bad online review: first, don&#8217;t ignore it and second, stay professional. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring a legitimate bad review simply makes potential customers wonder if you are willing to fix mistakes or if you will simply ignore unhappy customers. Make a public reply to the negative review, following this three-step format and staying tactful and courteous: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apologize. Even if the customer is over-reacting, start with a simple apology such as &#8220;I am so sorry you had a bad experience at our business.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correct facts if needed. If the customer has misrepresented the situation, state what actually happened. Stick to the facts, and don&#8217;t accuse the customer of lying. You can include phrases such as, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; or &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ve forgotten.&#8221; Cite the source of your information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for resolution. State your desire to recompense or otherwise resolve the situation and publicly ask the customer to contact you. You can say, &#8220;We want to make this right; please get in touch at [phone number] so we can fix our mistake.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be professional, friendly, and tactful. How you word your response will show future customers how you will respond if something goes wrong for them. A well-worded, thoughtful response can boost their confidence in your business, while an angry response can have the opposite effect. </span></p>
<p><b>Seek Resolution Privately</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are able to contact the customer by email or phone, do so with the same professional, courteous manner in which you wrote your reply. Apologize, listen to the customer, calmly explain factual mistakes, if appropriate, and then seek resolution by asking what you can do to make the customer happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re able to resolve the problem and win the customer back, follow up with another reply to the original negative review stating what steps you took and how the issue was resolved. The customer might also be willing to follow up on the original review with her own description of how you promptly and professionally handled the complaint. </span></p>
<p><b>Keep Getting Reviews</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proportions matter; a couple of negative reviews in a sea of positive ones matter less than one unpleasant review stacked against only one positive review. So keep sharing your review site information with customers; the more positive reviews you have, the more those few unpleasant ones will seem unimportant. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These seven titans of industry are household names, but they’ve worked hard to bring along the next generation of leaders – their children. In each company, father CEOs have worked closely with sons or daughters, and in turn, the children have often eclipsed their fathers’ success.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>1.</strong> </span><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Edward “Ned” Johnson III/Abigail Johnson: </b><b>Fidelity Investments</b></p>
<p>Fidelity Investments was founded by Ned Johnson’s father, Edward Johnson II, in 1946 and has grown to become one of the world’s largest investment firms. While Ned Johnson remains chairman of the board at Fidelity, daughter Abigail, 53, was named president and CEO in 2014. She rose through the ranks at Fidelity like her father, starting as an analyst in 1988 after earning an MBA at Harvard Business School, and was promoted to an executive role in 1997. While Ned was more of a risk-taker, his daughter is more pragmatic, wanting to see an opportunity from every angle before making a decision. Financially, Abigail has already eclipsed her dad in net worth; he is currently listed as the 63rd richest person on the Forbes list of the 400 Richest Americans, with $7.4 billion, and she is 35th, with $13.3 billion.</p>
<p><b>2. Paul Newman/Nell Newman: </b><b>Newman’s Own</b></p>
<p>Newman’s Own began as a partnership between actor Paul Newman and his author-friend A.E. Hotchner, who each put up $20,000 to establish the venture after the homemade salad dressing bottles they sent to friends and family one Christmas were a big hit. The duo then expanded into other products, such as spaghetti sauce, popcorn, and beverages. The goal of commercializing the products was to generate income that would be then donated to various charities. In 1993, Newman’s daughter, Nell, created a new division of the company, named Newman’s Own Organics, which marketed only food products created from organic ingredients. In 2001, the division was spun off as its own company, which Nell now runs. She and her dad, who died in 2008, are featured prominently together in company marketing materials.</p>
<p><b>3. Donald Trump/Ivanka Trump: </b><b>The Trump Organization</b></p>
<p>Ivanka Trump, 34, speaks with the same pace and inflections as her father, businessman Donald Trump, according to Leno and Letterman. It’s no surprise that Ivanka sounds a lot like her old man, since she is the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at The Trump Organization and works closely with her famous father. Donald Trump, a.k.a. The Donald, is of course the  self-made real estate magnate and host of the TV show <i>The Celebrity Apprentice</i>. He rose to fame through savvy Manhattan real estate purchases and turnarounds of bankrupt property. His older sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, also work closely with him in The Trump Organization and in the Trump Hotel Collection, a portfolio of luxury hotels and amenities. Donald is worth an estimated $4 billion, while Ivanka can boast an impressive $150 million, in part due to the jewelry line she designed and launched.</p>
<p><b>4. Carl Icahn/Brett Icahn: </b><b>Icahn Enterprises</b></p>
<p>Known primarily as a corporate raider, Carl Icahn began his career as a Wall Street stockbroker. He founded Icahn &amp; Co. in 1968 and, through the years, began to take controlling interests in public companies. His most famous was the hostile takeover of TWA in 1985, which he then split up and sold off for parts. Identifying undervalued companies relative to their stock price is how Icahn built his empire. Carl is now personally worth an estimated $20 billion. His son, Brett Icahn, 35, joined his father’s business in 2002 as an investment analyst and now holds a number of positions in many of Carl Icahn’s ventures. In 2011, the hedge fund Brett runs with business partner David Schechter earned a 50% return, so in 2012, Carl gave Brett $3 billion to manage.</p>
<p><b>5. Rupert Murdoch/James Murdoch: </b><b>News Corp.</b></p>
<p>The two Adelaide, Australia, newspapers that Rupert Murdoch inherited at age 22 became the foundation of a media conglomerate that now includes 120 publications – including the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> – a cable network that includes the Fox channels, publishing company HarperCollins, and 21st Century Fox movie studio. He is worth more than $13 billion. And he has long taken steps to install his son James in key management positions in his companies. Younger son James, 43, is currently chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox. James is credited with interesting his father in the Internet, and took over News Corp.’s internet operations in 1996. Both Murdochs were implicated in the illegal phone-hacking scandal at the British <i>News of the World</i>, which was ultimately shut down. No hard feelings though, apparently, as James recently paid $30 million to buy his dad’s old Beverly Hills home.</p>
<p><b style="line-height: 1.5;">6. Warren Buffett/Howard Buffett: </b><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b></p>
<p>Called the most successful investor of the 20th century, Warren Buffett is the creator of Berkshire Hathaway, a diversified holding company consisting of businesses in a wide variety of industries. Shares in the company, currently valued at more than $200,000, are the most expensive of any public Class A stock. While Warren has been managing his many holdings, his son and heir apparent, Howard Graham Buffett, 60, has been working as a farmer, a philanthropist, and a volunteer deputy sheriff, as well as a former executive. When his father dies, Howard “Howie” Buffett has been tapped to serve in a non-executive role as head of the enterprise. In other words, he will not make decisions about company management, but will ensure the culture and values of Berkshire Hathaway remain strong.</p>
<p>7. <b>Ralph Roberts/Brian Roberts: </b><b>Comcast </b></p>
<p>Ralph Roberts’ purchase of a 1,200-subscriber cable television system in Tupelo, Miss., in 1963 was the start of Comcast Corporation, which is now the country’s largest video, high-speed internet, and phone provider. Now founder and chairman emeritus of the board at the company he founded, Ralph, age 95, is more active in community service, while son Brian Roberts has taken the helm as chairman and CEO. He joined Comcast right after college and was later named president in 1990, when the company’s revenues were $657 million. They have since grown more than ten times that amount.</p>
