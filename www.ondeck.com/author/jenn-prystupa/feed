								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sandy Stroehmann is the owner of <a target="_blank" href="https://elixirmindbodymassage.com/">Elixir Mind Body Massage</a>, a spa and wellness center in Downtown Denver. Sandy spoke with us about her spa, the search for financing, and how she built a profitable business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your background and how you started your business.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a serial entrepreneur all my life. I love business and I have always known I wanted to be in business for myself.</p>
<p>The idea around my business was an interesting process. I was living in North Carolina, and I was the executive director of a non-profit children&#8217;s health museum. If you’ve worked for a non-profit, you know it can be stressful. To relieve the stress, I went for massages. This was long before massage was widely available. “You know, this is a great idea. I should do something like this someday, but a little bit differently.&#8221; I think the idea of a beautiful space and a variety of services adds to stress relief, pain relief, that kind of thing. I just wanted to tweak it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, I was living back East. Got a divorce, moved back home. And I started another company, and it was a good company. But I didn&#8217;t feel like I was making a difference, and in the back of my head, I kept getting this feeling, like, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you doing what you really want to do? Why aren&#8217;t you giving back?&#8221; So, I put together a business plan, got the funding together, and 18 months later, we opened Elixir. We&#8217;ve been open since June of 2007, and this will be our 12th year.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about being a small business owner, and specifically in this industry?</strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are a special breed. We absolutely love to create, and we have this dream, and we want to see it created, and evolve, and become something that is not just for us, but for everybody else.</p>
<p>I work with the most compassionate people, and we make a difference every day. People come here to see us because they&#8217;re in pain, they&#8217;re stressed, or they&#8217;re celebrating something. Being in an industry where we give back, it&#8217;s almost like the pebble in the water, where you can have an impact on one person, but that goodness ripples out to others. These kinds of things are really important to me, and I feel like we&#8217;re making a difference.</p>
<p><strong>What has been some of the biggest challenges as a small business owner? </strong></p>
<p>There have been several challenges, and they’re different depending on where we are in the business cycle. For us, kind of a constant is never having enough staff. We&#8217;ve got this great company, and we have a great product; however, we&#8217;re very picky about the people we bring on board. So, having hiring, training, retaining, that has always been a harder thing for me to do, and to do well. But it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve worked on, and we&#8217;ve got a great staff.</p>
<p><strong>In your business, you need to make sure your employees are efficient, so you can serve your guests in a timely manner. How do you go about doing this?</strong></p>
<p>We do a lot of training here, and education is a big part of who we are, both for our guests and our employees. We spend a great deal of time, anywhere from nine months to a year, to get all our service providers up to speed on our menu and services. We do a lot of training at the front desk as well, because it&#8217;s important that our front desk can do consultations, and really find out what works for our guests.</p>
<p>We have staff meetings every six weeks, which usually include a lot of training. There is also a regularly monthly session. We&#8217;re constantly doing evaluations with new employees. We have 30, 60, and 90-day evaluations where we&#8217;re checking in, coaching, and doing those things to bring them up to our standards of excellence.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What sources of capital did you look into?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, it was easy. It was a good economy, I had a great credit score, and I was able to secure a lot of funding.</p>
<p>That funding pretty much dried up once we had 2008 hit. We had a line of credit with some of the bigger banks, and rather than continue to allow us to take the line of credit, they just canceled it and it turned it into a loan. We no longer had access to additional capital, and it made things very difficult. The big banks really didn&#8217;t want to give any funding anymore, and I think a lot of small businesses ran into that.</p>
<p>Luckily, we were in a position where we had always positioned ourselves as more wellness, as opposed to a luxury, like many spas. When people were cutting back during the downturn in the economy, they were still coming here because they knew their health really mattered. So, we were doing well, but we didn&#8217;t have access to funding. When I ran into OnDeck, it was a godsend, because they actually wanted to work with me. And made it easy to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>So why did you choose OnDeck initially, and why have you come back?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck was more small business friendly. They were a little more expensive, but they were also so easy to work with, and the ability to get funds when I needed them enabled us to continue our business without any interruption.</p>
<p>I’ve come back to OnDeck for several reasons. They served me very well. Their customer service is exceptional. They also support the businesses that take loans from them. Their employees come to Elixir routinely. I always thought and appreciated the fact that they supported us that way. They also listen to their customers. I’ve been on customer forums at their offices here in Denver. And they would ask, &#8220;What things are we doing right, what kind of things do we need to be doing better?&#8221; And one of the things that I had mentioned was lines of credit are much better for me than loans. I rarely have the need for a loan, but sometimes I&#8217;ll need a quick infusion of cash that we can pay off quickly, where I don&#8217;t have a lot of interest expense. And next thing I knew, they had a line of credit available as part of their products.</p>
<p><strong>How have you used the money to grow your business?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve used it to hire staff, we&#8217;ve used it to create brand-new services, like our facials. We brought in new inventory. When we do training, when you&#8217;re hiring and spending all this money, you must do that for recruiting and everything, as well. We&#8217;ve also used it to create our own brand. Right now, we&#8217;re using it to rebrand and repackage our private label. So, all these things have helped to really increase not only the efficacy of our company, and the way that we serve our guests, but it&#8217;s also allowed us to expand and really move into some areas that have made us much more profitable.</p>
<p><strong>What have been some measurable results on your ROI? </strong></p>
<p>I have been able to hire two new managers to really help me more with the day-to-day operations, so I can spend more time working on the business instead of always working in it. I still work in the business, because I love it and I love our clients. But I do need to step back and work on the business, so that&#8217;s been really great. We&#8217;ve also hired a number of new staff. We have two new aestheticians. We&#8217;re constantly hiring new therapists. We&#8217;ve also added new equipment. We had to buy new equipment for our aesthetics and our facial room. We&#8217;ve increased our inventory. And of course, we&#8217;ve added our private label line and our repackaging that.</p>
<p><strong>How has flexible financing helped you achieve your goals?</strong></p>
<p>Anybody that has run a small business knows, it&#8217;s nice that you&#8217;re smaller, because you can turn on a dime. If you run across an opportunity, if you have an opportunity to do something different and you need fast cash to take advantage of that, you can. If an opportunity presents itself, I can jump on it, and I have. It also helps with unexpected expenses. These are the things that the flexibility allows me, and within a day, I have the financing I need to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></p>
<p>Evolution. We&#8217;ve seen so many changes in the last 12 years; we added facials in 2018 because so many of our clients were asking for that service, and it has been exciting to see the change and the different clients that have come in from that. We&#8217;re looking at some new software here shortly. And the rebrand of our private label is exciting because we’re working to expand our brand beyond Elixir and our guests.</p>

			<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Article Summary:</strong> The benefits to your business of building a strong online presence for your business purposes are twofold: it’s a way for prospective customers to find your business and a way for current customers to stay engaged.

<p>These six places are by no means exhaustive, but they will help with building your online presence and hopefully grow your ROI. Read below for actions you can take today.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Your Business Website</strong></h3>
<p>When you think of your business’s online presence, your website should be the first thing that comes to mind and where you devote the lion’s share of your efforts. This is where all your other online businesss pages link to, and any changes or updates will start here. Think of it as your home base.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions about your website and make any needed changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Days/hours of operation</strong> – are they up-to-date?</li>
<li><strong>Special holidays and hours </strong>– are you open or closed?</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong> – is it correct, and do you have multiples?</li>
<li><strong>Menus, products, services</strong> – do you have anything to add or remove?</li>
<li><strong>Copyright date</strong> – check your website’s footer to see if that’s current.</li>
<li><strong>Social media icons</strong> – do you have them, and do they link to your pages?</li>
<li><strong>Location/address</strong> – do you have Google Maps installed? Are all your locations listed?</li>
<li><strong>News</strong> – upload recent news articles about your business.</li>
<li><strong>Employees</strong> – do you list your employees, and is that list accurate?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Google</strong></h3>
<p>Your business’s Google listing is very important to keep updated. When a prospective customer is searching for a new restaurant, local plumber, or health care specialist, you want your listing details to be accurate so they don’t go to the wrong location or call the wrong number. There’s nothing worse than showing up at a business and it’s closed when it says open on Google!</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to start and maintain an accurate Google listing. Here are a few things to do on Google:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google My Business (GMB)</strong></a> – claim your free business profile to update to how your business appears in Google search and gain insights into how people are searching for your business. The great thing about GMB is you can get emails to remind you to make updates, such as:
<ul>
<li>Days and hours of operation</li>
<li>Special holidays and hours</li>
<li>Phone number(s)</li>
<li>Google Maps address</li>
<li>Photos &#8211; upload new photos of your business, storefront, and inside, if applicable. Encourage customers to leave photos, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Facebook</strong></h3>
<p>You may or may not have a social media online presence, but you should think of social media as an extension of your website. Facebook is really pushing itself as another search tool, like Google, and there are a few key things you can do to optimize your business Facebook page.</p>
<p>Check out these Facebook action items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a page template</strong> – Is your Facebook page set up to maximize your presence? Check out the Templates and Tabs section under Settings while logged into your business Facebook page. It is likely set to the default Standard template, but you can choose between that or Business, Service, Restaurant, and Shopping. Changing the template will change the tabs that appear on the left-hand side of your business page, but you can preview what those tabs are before you make a change. You also have a choice to turn on/off certain tabs.</li>
<li><strong>Page Info Tab – </strong>After you update your template, stay in Settings. Right above that is the Page Info tab. In there, you can make changes to days/hours of operation, phone number, email, website URL, location, parking availability, public transit, and price range. These changes should automatically update in your About Section, too.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs Tab – </strong>One of Facebook’s more recent changes, you can now advertise any open jobs you have right on your page. Make sure you add/remove jobs when needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Instagram </strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that Instagram is owned by Facebook? You get many of the advertising and posting benefits on Instagram as you would on Facebook. This can help streamline your online presence on both sites.</p>
<p>Things to look out for on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sign up for Instagram Business Tools</strong> – take advantage of the following items by either signing up or upgrading your current Instagram account to Instagram Business. You can do that by going to your current profile and clicking on Edit Profile. The prompt should be right below your bio.</li>
<li><strong>Business bio</strong> – Similar to Facebook’s About section. Provide a brief and accurate description of your business products or services.</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong> <strong>URL</strong> – add your business’s website. This is the only place where you can have a link in Instagram. Links do not work in photo or video posts.</li>
<li><strong>Category </strong>– ensure your Instagram account is categorized correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Options</strong> – you can include your email, phone number, and business address.</li>
<li><strong>Action Button</strong> – find this under Contact Options. Give your customers a call-to-action, like “book,” “reserve,” and “order,” through third-party integrations like OpenTable and GrubHub.</li>
<li><strong>Photos </strong>– you want to make sure you have fresh photos uploaded weekly. If you want, you can post the same exact thing on Instagram as your Business’s Facebook account at the same time. Just make sure they are linked.</li>
<li><strong>Hashtags </strong>– when you do post, use appropriate hashtags so people who are not your followers can find your business page. Use as many relevant hashtags as possible to broaden your reach.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> 5. </strong><strong>LinkedIn</strong></h3>
<p>You may already have a personal online presence via your professional LinkedIn page. But LinkedIn is also good place to build out your business’s online presence, too.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can do on LinkedIn:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On your Professional Page</strong> – Make sure your Title and Contact info, Experience (i.e., your business), and Summary are updated. Provide a clear headshot, and wear branded clothes, if applicable. In your contact info, you can provide your business email, phone, address, and website URL.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Company Page</strong> – If you don’t already have a LinkedIn profile for your business, you can create one while you’re logged in to your professional profile. At the top right of the page, next to your picture, is the “Work” dropdown. Click that, and at the bottom, there is an option to “Create a Company Page.”</li>
<li><strong>Company Page to-dos &#8211; </strong>Once you have a Company Page, you can fill out the profile to include your website, phone number, jobs, and photos.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>6. Reviews</strong></h3>
<p>There’s a good chance that prospective customers are shopping around before they decide to patronize your business. Today, 65 percent of the buy journey starts with online search.  Having positive, recent reviews are an important part of building your business online presence and helping people who are looking online for your products or services to find your business.</p>
<p>Where should you collect reviews? Both <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> have review collection functions, and both also display your star rating of 1*-5* next to your business profile when someone searches for it. For Facebook, you’d need to turn on the Reviews Tab to display reviews.</p>
<p>Also consider industry-specific review sites. You want to go where your customers are searching for your business. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.angieslist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Angies’ List</strong></a> –for service provides</li>
<li><a href="https://www.opentable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OpenTable</strong></a> and <a href="https://resy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Resy</strong></a> –for restaurants</li>
<li><a href="https://services.amazon.com/amazon-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> –for businesses that sell online</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask, and ask often. Fresh reviews show engagement with your website, and search engines like Google look favorably on that increase in traffic—so make sure you’re regularly asking your customers to review your business and talk about why they like doing business with you.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t hurt to show reviews on your website. As a best practice, it’s a good idea to link to the review or to the review site so prospects can do their own research.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Stay on top of it!</u></strong></h2>
<p>It may sound like a lot of things to tick off the list, but you need to consider what type of online presence makes sense for your business before you dive in.</p>
<p>You may have time to knock out these action items in an afternoon and set up monthly reminders to make sure everything is still up-to-date. Or if your team has bandwidth, appoint one or two employees to make sure the listings are accurate, and that reviews are coming in. Delegation can be your friend!</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the age of the mobile, online reviews of your business are easier than ever for customers to write, and for potential customers to access. Before checking out a new store or the latest restaurant, potential customers frequently whip out Yelp or the company’s Facebook page. Positive reviews boost your visibility, give you a good reputation, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">downplay the occasional negative comment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and encourage business growth. So, how do you secure them?</span></p>
<h4><b>Foster relationships.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The key to good reviews isn’t just hoping you wowed your customers enough that they’ll take the time to review you—it’s developing a relationship with them that leaves them excited to support you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asking for reviews by being pushy will get you nowhere. Make sure customers know that their input matters to you, both online and off. Positive or negative, enlightening or blah—tell them that whatever they think about your business is helpful. Asking them to provide honest feedback instead of just a 4-star ranking, as well as ensuring them you’ll take it seriously, will make customers more motivated to let the world wide web know their thoughts. </span></p>
<h4><b>Turn negative into positive.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’ve received a negative review from someone, don’t just close your eyes and wish it would disappear. Confront the customer in a straightforward and kind way by asking what you could have done to provide better service. It’s a fact of life that the more reviews you get, one or two negative ones will start popping up. You can’t satisfy every customer 100 percent, but a review’s author may be surprised and probably impressed that you cared enough to reach out to them and are trying to improve your business as best you can. If it’s feasible&#8211;and you think you can improve upon a person’s experience&#8211;invite him or her back to try your product or service when you’re at your best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even if you can’t repair every single complaint a reviewer has uttered, you can take the time to read all your reviews, both good and bad, and learn from them. If there’s a consistent area where customers aren’t happy with you, fix the problem, and even go above and beyond. New visitors will notice the good service, and, if they’ve read your reviews before coming, they may be so happy they’ll be inspired to debate your negative reviewers on their own.</span></p>
<h4><b>Think industry specific review sites.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Managing the lesser-known, industry specific review sites can be just an important as focusing on the biggies Yelp, Angie’s List, Facebook, and Google, to name a few. Most industries have their own review sites, ZocDoc for medical, YourMechanic for auto-body shops, etc.  These sites often come up high in google rankings, but they&#8217;re likely not top of mind for your customers, so encourage them to leave reviews on those sites as well .</span></p>
<h4><b>Freebies and giveaways.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you’re desperate for more reviews as soon as possible, giveaways never hurt. You might offer a gift card, a discount, or another promotion to someone for entering a review—positive or negative. This won’t just encourage them to leave their thoughts, it’ll encourage them to continue frequenting your business. It’s another way to develop a relationship with your customer, and a devoted customer, of course, is more likely to want to review you well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remember, no incentives will ever inspire people to leave a review as much as a great experience. Making sure your customer service is top-notch is the surest way to create loyal customers who are passionate about your company and will, in turn, feel compelled to tell others.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <strong>Devoughn Owens</strong> founded Meadowlark Home Care in 1997, it was her instincts that told her people would always need nurses, not statistics. Home care services is one of the fastest growing industries in the country. According the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, it&#8217;s projected to grow <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm#tab-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41%</a> from 2016-2026.</p>
<p>Devoughn started out in undergrad at Louisiana State and majored in journalism, she had no intention of becoming anything besides a journalist. However, when she graduated, there were no jobs in her area of study. She worked a few jobs here and there, but that was it. It was then she decided it wasn’t working out and she needed to do something productive. She made the tough decision and went back to school. She told herself &#8220;no matter what is going on in the world, I’m going to graduate with a degree that will serve me for many years to come.&#8221; Wayne State University had an accelerated nursing program, so pursued that because there is always need for nurses.</p>
<p>After she graduated she worked in the Intensive Care Unit at Detroit Receiving Hospital and then at Western Wayne Correctional Facility. At that time, she and her brother wanted to set up a group home together. We looked at group homes in Detroit, but most weren’t set up for them to be grandfathered in, which would’ve been more cost effective. She already had a house in Oak Park, and that wound up working out. &#8220;I made the decision in May 1997 to use my home for the group home, and in October 1997, I was licensed and up and running.&#8221;</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">1.</span> What services does your business provide?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>We specialize in home care services for patients with mental illness, dementia, and developmental disabilities. I have two homes that are at capacity: one in Oak Park and Southfield. Our goal is to meet their mental, physical, and spiritual needs in order for them to be as complete and whole as possible.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">2.</span> Did you learn how to run your business on the fly, or did you have any help from friends or peers? </strong></h4>
<p>I came into contact with a lot of individuals who had a wealth of knowledge about the Adult Foster Care business and they were not afraid to share their information. With my Journalism and Nursing degrees, it made it easy to set the foundation for the business to develop policies and procedures, employee and client files, and to meet off of the state and local agency requirements.</p>
<p>My advice to other business owners would be to collect as much knowledge as possible and be a sponge when people are willing to share their stories. Don&#8217;t be afraid to pursue your dreams and your vision. God gave them to you don&#8217;t let them go to waste. Walk in your talents and take hold of any and all counsel that you receive along the way.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">3.</span> How do you market your services to potential clients? </strong></h4>
<p>For me, it’s less about putting ads on social media or in the newspaper. In my business, it starts by developing those face-to-face relationships with agencies such as Macomb Oakland Regional Center (MORC) and Easter Seals, and the families of the individuals that we provide services for. Once we got to know each other and they were able to see how the clients were progressing and how comfortable they were with our services, a level of trust was established. When you build and maintain a level of trust this enables contracts to continue to be renewed.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff"> 4.</span> </strong><strong>What types of challenges do you and your employees encounter on a daily basis, and how do you handle them?</strong></h4>
<p>I have 14 employees and I think that I’ve been fortunate that my staff has been around for a little while. Like in many businesses, employees who don’t have the same intent as you, or lack compassion toward their clients or peers eventually weed themselves out. As the business owner, the hardest thing is to get everyone to buy into your vision, and in my case, my vision is to treat people like their family. In the end, whether they do or don’t is a direct reflection on me.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff"> 5.</span> </strong><strong>It must be rewarding, to provide care to people who otherwise cannot care for themselves. Do you see your business as a business, or something else? </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I can be a nurse doing other things or working in other facilities making more money than I am now. But that’s not what I want to do. I feel I was put on this earth for this purpose. Servicing individuals is my passion and calling.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">6.</span> </strong><strong>What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I am always looking at ways to expand and grow my business on a daily basis. I try to find out what the need is with the local agencies that we provide services for and expand on that. I pray that God will continue to put me in a position to meet individuals that can help me with this.</p>

<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">7.</span> What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I’ve been in business for over 20 years. So, when I initially started, I did a line of credit off the home to do renovations and get things up and running. Things were a lot different back then. But all things change over time, from the agencies I worked with to how I financed my business.</p>
<p>I had tried to get money from my bank, but they said my debt ratio was too high. I banked with them for so long, and they knew how much money I had! It was very frustrating. But then I found OnDeck and they took me on.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">8.</span> How are you using your OnDeck funds? </strong></h4>
<p>I have both a term loan and a line of credit from OnDeck, and I’m using both to sustain the business when I have vacancies in my homes. Any business owner knows that your revenues can change over a period of time, but expenses do not. So how do you meet the expenses when the revenue goes down? You need to borrow a little until you fill that vacancy so you can keep paying your bills, make payroll, etc. It’s smart business. I thank God for OnDeck because they were willing to give me a chance when no other lending agency would. I will always be grateful and thankful for OnDeck.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">9.</span> What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></h4>
<p>I have to say I’m blessed because a lot of group homes have closed, but we’re still here. But I admit, I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up! I want to grow the business responsibly and not get too big, because you run the risk of losing touch and not provide the personal service your patients are used to. I might look at expanding our services to do something else, like workshops teaching people basic life skills. Some programs out there now do more for certain individuals and others there not. I’d like to bridge that gap.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Reed Shiraki, the owner of Honor Box Chiropractic, a practice in Pearl City, Hawaii. (yes, we&#8217;re jealous!) His business story is inspiring and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>1. Tell us about your background and how you started your business.</strong></span></h4>
<p>My journey to chiropractor and small business owner was not a straight path. When I graduated high school I actually wanted to be a painter, so when I enrolled in BYU-Provo I was an art major. I did my church mission in Hiroshima, Japan and came back with a refreshed view of what I wanted to do. I became a recreational management major because I really enjoyed working with kids.</p>
<p>I switched majors again at the encouragement of my now wife, Eriko. My new plan was to graduate with a Japanese language bachelor&#8217;s and then go to law school. I was on my way, but then four months later it dawned on me &#8211; I didn’t want to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>I visited the BYU Counseling and Career Center for some inspiration and as I was browsing the brochures I saw one on chiropractic and what a career could be. I knew instantly that’s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Three months later, my pregnant wife and I moved from Provo to Kansas City so I could attend Cleveland Chiropractic College. In 1998, we moved back to Hawaii and I started as an associate at Hawaii Chiropractic Clinic in Aiea, Not too long after I opened up Hawaiian Pacific Chiropractic in Kalihi. In 2013, I opened a new clinic in Pearl City and renamed my practice Honor Box Chiropractic.</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">2. What services does your business provide?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Everything we do centers around the chiropractic adjustment. The first appointment includes palpation and observation of movement and posture, physiotherapy (like ice, heath, traction, or elective stimulation), and a percussion massage to loosen up the back. In the second appointment, our customers can expect their adjustment.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">3. What is The Honor Box Code, and what does it mean to provide care to those who may not be able to afford it or who cannot use their insurance?</strong></h4>
<p>I truly believe that spinal alignment is a key element of good health. Most people look at chiropractic as if it&#8217;s a kind of luxury &#8212; something nice to treat yourself with from time to time, especially when pain hits. However, I believe a healthy spine is absolutely necessary to achieve optimal health. The Honor Box provides a way for me take care of every single person who walks into my office, regardless of their financial situation. This Honor Box system is often called a blessing by my patients who use and appreciate it, but it actually is a greater blessing for our practice, because it allows me to focus solely on the welfare of the patient without the stress and worry of &#8220;selling&#8221; my services. The Honor Box has helped me develop into the best chiropractor I can be.</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">4. You have some great reviews on Facebook and your website. How valuable are testimonials and reviews to your business?</strong></h4>
<p>Right now, to me, the value of positive reviews and testimonials have less to do with attracting new business, and way more to do with the way that these affirmations from others reinforce to us that we are doing the right thing, in the right way, and offering a service that is truly appreciated by others. This is a boost to our Honor Box&#8217;s team morale and strengthens are resolve to persevere and press forward, knowing we are on the right track.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174013 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-2.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="OnDeck Customer Testimonial - HonorBox" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-2.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">5. What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></h4>
<p>Because of the volatile nature of collections through the Honor Box, it is vital that I record and analyze stats on a daily basis. Key stats I look at every day include: amount of total patient visits, amount of new patient visits, total collections for the day, and the average amount collected per patient visit. While the fluctuations of stats between the highs and lows can be overwhelming at times, over the years since 2001, I have a firm idea of what I can rely on as an expected average of these key stats when looked at with a long-term perspective.</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">6. What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What about your industry made it challenging to obtain financing?</strong></h4>
<p>In 2013, I really wanted to move my practice from Honolulu to Pearl City. There was a perfect office space available at the time where I wanted to set up my practice. The move, new lease agreement, and build-out costs would &#8211; on a shoestring budget &#8211; run me close to 100K. My savings, a business line of credit from my bank, and a SBA loan would cover just over half of that. Right when I thought that the new office would not work out, I got an OnDeck mailer. I thought that I had nothing to lose, so I applied. I was stunned how quick the approval and funding happened. Where my local bank took several weeks to approve my SBA loan and then get the funds into my account, OnDeck took only a couple days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174014 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">7. How have you used your OnDeck financing?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I originally used OnDeck funds to build my dream practice in Pearl City. Since then, I&#8217;ve used additional financing to run advertising campaigns on radio and TV, as well as extra working capital to hire a new doctor to work here with me at Honor Box Chiropractic. My last weeks of practice in my Honolulu office, I was averaging about 285 patient visits a week. Last week, my office cared for 527 – that’s an 85% increase! We are growing!</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">8. What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business? What’s on the horizon for Honor Box Chiropractic?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I am most excited when I think about all the people we can still help. The ones who are currently racked with pain taking pill after pill just to find some relief &#8211; who with chiropractic can get off the prescriptions and start enjoying life. I am excited to help more and more patients achieve a better life through chiropractic care. In 2018, we will be using some of OnDeck financing to launch a one-year newspaper campaign to tell even more people in Hawaii about the Honor Box and the power of chiropractic!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of interviewing Moe Habibi, founder and owner of STACK restaurant in Blackwell, Oklahoma. His story, business know-how, and pancakes are impressive.</p>
<p>Moe Habibi immigrated to the United States on September 7, 1977 from Iran. He didn’t know a single word of English outside of “Hello, how are you?” and he had no friends or family here. Moe arrived in the US with about $45 in his pocket, directly to Oklahoma and stayed for a year. He went to school in Arkansas, and when he finished he moved back to Oklahoma and has been there since. <strong><span style="color: #0074ff">“</span>Those were crazy, but fun days!<span style="color: #0074ff">” </span></strong>He’s worked in the hospitality industry for most of his life, the vast majority of it in the restaurant industry. <strong><span style="color: #0074ff">“</span>Opening my own restaurant was always my plan, and I remember the day I started STACK Restaurant. It was Monday June 15, 1998 and we’ve been operating since!<span style="color: #0074ff">”</span></strong></p>
<h3><strong><img class="wp-image-169701 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-10.22.57-PM.png?resize=38%2C38&#038;ssl=1" alt="OnDeck Square Logo" width="38" height="38" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-10.22.57-PM.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-10.22.57-PM.png?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-10.22.57-PM.png?resize=768%2C764&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-10.22.57-PM.png?w=796&amp;ssl=1 796w" sizes="(max-width: 38px) 100vw, 38px" data-recalc-dims="1" />What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Moe Habibi:</strong> At the beginning, I knew that I had to spend a lot of time <em>at</em> work, but I really wish I knew that as a small business owner you also have to be a Jack-of-all-Trades. Running a restaurant means more than knowing a lot about food. There are mounds of paperwork and bookkeeping to do, not to mention being your own handyman to fix the occasional breakdown. And then there is growing as a people manager – you have to learn how to be a person who is firm, fair, humble, and kind!</p>

<h3><strong>What types of challenges have you encountered, and how did you overcome them?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> A challenge that I will always remember happened during one Thanksgiving. We are always open on Thanksgiving to serve the elderly in our community who may not have a place to go, or are too tired to prepare a meal for themselves. We are often very busy. When I arrived at work that day, I discovered that the main drain was clogged and we had no way of disposing the waste water. As I was trying to figure out what to do, my crew chief informed me that ice machine had stopped working. I called the plumber, and he said he would not work on Thanksgiving, but he would let me use his drain snake if I go get it. So I traveled 20 miles to pick it up and I opened the drain myself. I would up fixing the ice machine after the repairman declined to come out, too. What a day! Staying calm and telling yourself that this will pass and things will work out is very helpful.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Stack Restaurant best known for? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> PANCAKES! I’ve used the same recipe for 44 years, coming up with it when I was 19 years old. The pancakes are our best seller, and time and time again I hear people saying that our pancakes are better than a certain chain restaurants’, which of course makes me very happy!</p>

<h3><strong>What has your customers coming back and your employees staying on board? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> The same people sit at the same table and order the same food daily. It’s great to see, and I try to come up with ways to reward customers, like buy-one, get-one half off dinners. Promotions like that are a good way to instill loyalty. The servers are motivated, too. For every special they sold, they earned three breaks. You do it not just because of money, but because a piece of you loves to serve the community and make your employees happy. My longest serving employee has been with me for 11 years. A tenure like that is so valuable because they know the business almost as much as I do!</p>

<h3>How do you assess your business growth? What do you look at to know how your business is trending? This could be top line/bottom line, etc.</h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> When the customer says, “This is the best soup I ever had, this is the best pancake I ever had,” you know you’re doing something right. I can look at how fast we move stock and inventory off the shelves and know that business is doing well.</p>

<h3><strong>Did you look at banks during your search for financing? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> Banks are not easy to deal with. They want to loan money to someone who does not need the loan, not a small restaurant owner who needs a small loan yesterday. OnDeck wants to work with someone who will put the money into their business as soon as they get it, and who can appreciate fast funding because your business’s success depends on getting back to operating as normal.</p>

<h3><strong>What did you like about OnDeck that made you choose us?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> One reason I liked OnDeck was because they report payments to the credit bureaus, and I wanted to improve my personal and business credit profiles. I use the first round of funds for cash flow management, and the next time I work with OnDeck, I will use the money to do some repair work on the drywall behind our dishwater.</p>
<p>But I chose to work with OnDeck because of the people. The service was great, and my representative was very nice and friendly. I get the feeling that OnDeck has your back and they are there to help you succeed. If I need a helping hand, OnDeck is there for me. It’s awesome.</p>

<h3><strong>What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business? Any tips for your peers?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MH:</strong> Opening more restaurants and employing more people is a goal of mine. There are 10 rules to have when running your own business. Rule #1 is never run out of cash, and Rule #10 is also never run out of cash! Whatever the heck you do from #2 to #9 does not make any difference. Open the new location when you have the funds or access to the funds without hurting your current location is the way to go.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of speaking with OnDeck customer, Meghan Garrity, owner of <strong>Performance Detailing, </strong>an auto detailing and performance parts service in Orland Park, IL. We talked about her background, what it&#8217;s like to own a small business, how she and her husband Doug manage the day-to-day, as well as prepare for the future.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: Tell me about your background.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meghan Garrity:</strong> My background is in management. I worked in restaurants for over 15 years, and went through the whole gamut – waitress, bartender, and manager – at a popular chain named after a day of the week. The skills I learned in the restaurant business have helped with managing people and with customer service. Doug’s background is in high performance automobiles, including wrenching and racing. Doug helped build one of the fastest street cars for Sutton Ford when their High Performance Parts department was still open. Doug and his brother race 79’ trans Am and a 70.5’ Trans Am. They are fixtures at Route 66 in Joliet, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How did the idea of your business begin, and what services does your business provide?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Doug always wanted to own some sort of speed shop or detailing business. When he was let go from Ford because of the recession, we thought it would be a brilliant time to open a business. He led Ford’s High Performance Department, so he had a lot of valuable experience. And I always said, if we can start a business during a down economy, we can get through anything.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I wish we knew that the leap of faith was going to be worth the struggle! We started with no employees and no money, so like a lot of business owners we pinched pennies and worked all hours of the night. I was about six months pregnant at the time with our first child and still working a full-time job. Doug would work until midnight and start again at 7am. The shop had to work because that was our livelihood.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-172845 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="performance-detailing | OnDeck Resource Center" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How did you start marketing your services? What tactics have you had the most success with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> When we first started, we used any type of free or low-cost option available: social media, flyers, etc. The best marketing so far has been Groupon, social media, and good old-fashioned word of mouth. Groupon was great for advertising because it got our name out there and also helped with referrals. We see a lot of customers now calling and telling us they are on their second or third vehicle that we have tinted, which is really exciting! We also do work for our village’s Public Works Department, and that has been beneficial to getting our name out to a larger local audience, including the police and fire departments. Doug’s ties to the automotive community helps, too, since car guys like doing work with other car guys!</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: You have a storefront and an online store. What are the different ways you market products on both, and are the promotion elements the same or different? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I am able to do most of my marketing from the comfort of my home using different apps and social media platforms. Strategy is mostly the same, but depending on what I am marketing, it makes a difference in whom I am marketing to. Jeep and off-road accessories are usually marketed online, while detailing and tint is usually marketed through email or local platforms. Sales are mostly from local dealership business and online comes from a large Female Jeep club I admin on.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: Speaking of social media, you have a robust presence on a few platforms. What is the key to keeping up with regular posts, and do you have any tips that may help other business owners with their social media? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Social media is extremely important, especially when dealing with a younger demographic. My biggest advice is to stay current and relevant and post and respond often. Follow businesses that inspire you and have a good presence, and this will give you a template for what to post. Also, I use many different apps on my phone for adding text and watermarks &#8211; this helps with uniformity.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How valuable customer reviews to your business, and how do you handle any negative comments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Reviews are important, but unfortunately in today’s world you get fake negative reviews from time to time.  As far as responding to our reviews, we always look to fix any type of negative situation with a positive as soon as we can. Whether the customer is willing to work with us on a resolve is another issue. If we believe the review is false we simple respond with additional questions like “when were you here, what vehicle did you have.” I think our customers are savvy enough to spot a real review from a fake.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> We monitor a lot of metrics including website traffic, Google ads, and Facebook trends. This gives me a good idea of what is working and what isn’t. We can usually see if an ad is working based on the clicks and sales. The weather plays a big part in our sales, too. When the first snowstorm hits, we see products like remote starters skyrocket!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172846" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="performance-detailing | OnDeck Resource Center" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What sources of capital did you look into? What did you like about OnDeck?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Financing is hard especially when you are a new business. Banks want to see numbers and a good credit history. We turned to OnDeck for our last 5-6 small loans. Honestly, we researched other banks and companies, and our OnDeck representative is friendly and takes time out to talk with us. It’s the customer service that stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How has OnDeck helped your business grow? ROI, hires, top/bottom line increases, new clients?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> OnDeck has given us the freedom to run our business with peace of mind. It has been a convenient and simple process obtaining the funds needed for our business. We recently expanded and had quite a bit of overhead with new flooring, lighting, displays, and more. OnDeck was able to provide us with the money we needed to make it a smooth transition. With the expansion, we were able to purchase new equipment that helped to speed up operation and increase our profit by 20% in that department.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Doug and I are looking forward to retirement! But until then, we’d like to franchise or open a second location.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sue Kolupar spent 36 years in the medical field at a practice, and her daughters were in a German dance group and went to a formal ball every year. That meant that each year she had to look for dresses. Fast-forward years later and one of her daughters went off to college in California, and she returned home to Milwaukee to buy a specific dress for a dance. They went to find this special dress at the same shop they used to go to all the time, but they found out the shop closed because the owner passed away. Sue called the strip mall to see if they would sell her any of the remaining dresses, and the person on the phone asked, “you want to buy the store?” and she first answered, “no, just a dress!” But after thinking about the business opportunity, she told her husband that it would be fun to have the shop as a side business, so she did! She bought the shop in 2006, and a year later she was diagnosed with breast cancer and fired from her medical job. &#8220;That helped me decide to take over the shop.&#8221; <a href="http://dressedintime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dressed in Time</strong></a> sells prom and pageant dresses mostly, along with some mother-of-the-bride and bridesmaids dresses, too.</p>
<h4><strong>Jenn Prystupa, OnDeck: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Sue Kolupar, Owner of Dressed in Time:</strong> Social media marketing! I wish I was more technically savvy. I’m trying to market a different crowd – teenage girls. Back in the day, we would advertise on radio, newspaper, the Yellow Pages – that doesn’t work for this type of business anymore and definitely not for my target customers. We need to compete with the online stories and to do so, we need to advertise online. We’re doing that now, but I wish I knew more much sooner.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: Who makes up your client base? How do you establish relationships, especially with families? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> High school girls and their parents are my core clients. I’m super hands on in my shop and I have hardly any staff, so each customer takes up a lot of my time, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m all about customer service, and I will bend over backwards for them.</p>
<p>Word of mouth at the eight local high schools is huge for me. I have the opportunity to sell a dress to one girl at least twice in her high school tenure, so it’s important to provide the best possible customer service to her, her parents, siblings and friends so I can keep that relationship going. I also hire a few girls who have the opportunity to work co-op. It’s great because they get retail experience and see all the new dresses coming in…and then they go tell their friends and parents! I have some girls that are prom customers coming back for white gowns later on in life based on their relationship with me.</p>

<h4><strong>JP: What marketing tactics have you had the most success with?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Much of my marketing is also based on social networks, like Instagram. On that network, I have pictures of girls holding their dress bags, and in the background is a huge banner with my logo. That has gotten me a fair amount of followers because the girls share the photos and their friends see them, too. I also work with an Instagram account called PagentPlanet, which posts a feature dress of the week from me, and I’ve seen growth in followers from that partnership. I find it very important to identify online influencers that your target customers are following, and see how you can engage with their audiences.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: How do you access your business growth?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Each year I’m trying to grow my sales by $50,000. I’m always looking at my sales, what schools are sending me the most customers, and what schools I need to target. There are some schools that buy less than me versus others, so it’s always a challenge to see how I can break through and bring more of them into the fold.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: What made you look for funding? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Every year we’ve grown, but there are times we get low on cash that coincide with opportunities to stock up on the latest fashions. I sell a chunk of inventory January through May, and a little bit through August. Then it kind of drops, but prime time inventory season, even if I still have old inventory on my floor not selling as fast as I’d like. I haven’t taken a salary from this business because of the medical job I had, and I’ve just reinvested my profits into inventory each year. Until I found OnDeck, my old position fed into Dressed in Time, but I still needed additional capital to really get ahead.</p>

<h4><strong>JP: What did you like about OnDeck that made you choose us?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> OnDeck was the easiest to work with. The process was fast, and I felt like they valued my business for what it is. The customer service was fantastic each time I needed something or had a question. That’s very important to me and it defines my business philosophy. You don’t get that personal touch with online and department stores, and for that matter, banks, nowadays.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: How has OnDeck helped your business grow? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> We’re on track to hit $70,000 more in sales this year thanks to OnDeck providing me with funds to purchase inventory. I need to be able to buy what I need, when it must be bought, and OnDeck was there for me.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Every year is exciting, trying to beat the previous year’s sales. And I love seeing girls coming into my store each day. It really is a happy atmosphere…the medical field, not so much. I’m not sure what I’m going to do when I approach retirement, but I love the work I do and I love the reward of seeing a smiling face.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Coolidge spent 8.5 years in the Marine Corps, and was always interested in technology. While he was serving, he met another Marine who was going to college for computer science and they began building and marketing some small mobile applications – they then founded Majestyk Apps. Since then, He’s founded several companies, made a few small start-up investments, and mentors other military veterans who are trying to get involved in “tech.”</p>
<p>I interviewed Donald about his businesses, his successes, his challenges, and how financing helped him grow from a small start-up with small clients to a successful business servicing brand name companies.</p>

We’ve established ourselves as one of the best design and tech agencies in New York.</p>
<p>We started by building a few small apps and marketing them on a tiny (sometimes non-existent) budget. This helped us get our name out and we began gradually adding services and doing work for larger and larger brands. In the last 12 months, we’ve launched tech products for six Fortune 500 companies.</p>

We’ve done really well over the last few years even though we made a very obvious mistake right in the beginning. We purposely misspelled our name, and that’s caused some challenges marketing the company because people will search for us by using “majestic” instead of Majestyk. This has likely caused us to lose lots of potential business and hurts our digital marketing efforts. BUT – we love the name and are too stubborn to rebrand it.</p>

We weren’t in any position to spend big on marketing, so we really relied on the strengths of our relationships from our young professional careers. We took a leap of faith with our contacts in key industries, and asked for introductions. They trust us already, which saved us a lot of time. We broke even or lost money on most of our early projects in order to build our portfolio. That’s why going to a traditional lender didn’t work for us.</p>

<h4><span style="color: #000082"><strong>What’s it like working with smaller companies and bigger corporate clients?</strong></span></h4>

Each with their own pros and cons.</p>
<p>Startups have smaller budgets and you always face the potential of never getting paid. But, they typically have better payment terms and it is a lot of fun to dig into their strategy and help them build from the ground up.  It’s amazing to watch a first time entrepreneur get their app accepted by the app store and “launched” for the first time.</p>
<p>The corporate clients are great because they have more resources to invest into the projects, and when they launch they have big marketing efforts to help scale. But, they put a large strain on a smaller company’s cash flow because they normally have standard payment terms that are net 90 days or sometimes more. And then you have to navigate through their internal payment process. This was where OnDeck was key for us in providing the funding needed to weather the longer payment terms. Because of that funding early in our growth, we were able to secure our first few Fortune 500 clients. And the apps we built for them were AWESOME.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-170257" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?resize=30%2C30&#038;ssl=1" alt="Donald Coolidge Customer Testimonial Majestyk Apps | OnDeck" width="30" height="30" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?w=308&amp;ssl=1 308w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 30px) 100vw, 30px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Biggest one is revenue, which is what I look at constantly and try my best to predict future revenue streams. It’s actually more important to us than profit, which seems counter-intuitive. But we are looking to cement our position in a competitive industry and once we hit our revenue goal, we will optimize our profit margins. A very tech-centric approach.</p>
<p>Eyeballs are another way we can look at our growth. While you can’t always quantify the impact, we can look at the client base we’ve acquired over the last several years – IBM, Citi, Pepsi&#8230;these apps or websites are great for our portfolio and also get millions of people using tech we’ve built. This is great for our brand but also motivates our internal team. They know they are working on really cool products. One website we built just launched with TV commercials at the Grammys.</p>

<h4><span style="color: #000082"><strong>What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What sources of capital did you look into? </strong></span></h4>

There were two or three major clients we were about to land, and we needed to put in bids upfront and scale our resources, because we were going to need help fast. At first, we went to banks for the financing, but we were turned down because we were a young business without a credit history – and mind you, we were profitable.</p>

<h4><span style="color: #000082"><strong>What did you like about OnDeck that made you choose us?</strong></span></h4>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-170257" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?resize=30%2C30&#038;ssl=1" alt="Donald Coolidge Customer Testimonial Majestyk Apps | OnDeck" width="30" height="30" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?w=308&amp;ssl=1 308w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-09-at-10.58.39-AM.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 30px) 100vw, 30px" data-recalc-dims="1" />OnDeck was convenient and it didn’t take forever. The banks require tons of paperwork, which handcuffs the ability to take out the loan. It was a couple days turnaround for OnDeck. And with OnDeck’s quick financing, we won the bids, and from there we started to grow. It was a great move for the portfolio.</p>

Our headcount has doubled as we took on more big name projects, largely because we now have the resources to bid on bigger projects and invest into winning the deals.</p>

We have a great team and culture. My employees are always bring new ideas to the table, which makes us all really excited. We keep asking ourselves: how can we work with influencers? How can we use technology better?</p>
<p>This happened recently when we had a really great concept, internally built a prototype, and pitched it to IBM and their Watson team. They loved it and we partnered with IBM to build it out further. We raised several million dollars in investment, were named a TIME Magazine Best Invention of 2015, spun the company out, and it now has 20 employees. This was 100% conceived within Majestyk by our amazing team.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>5 Tips to Evaluating Your Small Business Social Media Marketing </strong></span></h1>
<p>When was the last time you evaluated your small business’s social media marketing strategy? It&#8217;s never a bad time to take a look back, assess, and see where you can make some improvements to end the year on a high note.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these 5 social media questions I believe are essential for small business growth, great customer service, and cost-effective marketing.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>1. Is Your Current Social Media Presence the Right One?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Your business might be active on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, LinkedIn and others. Ask yourself, is this the right strategy? Are you seeing the returns you want on all social media sites, or just some? The key is to know where your customers are active. You do not want to promote your business services or products where they are not – don’t waste your time and resources, especially if you are using paid social.</p>
<p>Limit yourself to where your audience lives, and what is manageable for you or your staff to handle. Remember, social media isn’t a one and done deal. It needs constant nurturing. Don’t create a social media page for the sake of creating one. Every page should have a business purpose!</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164861"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164861" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?resize=1000%2C972&#038;ssl=1" alt="small business social media marketing OnDeck" width="1000" height="972" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?resize=768%2C746&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>2. Is Your Social Page Set Up to Sell?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Use your social media page like a landing page for your website to boost your sales. Social media sites have integrated ways for you to sell your product or promote your service very deliberately. This is a great way for you to encourage a transaction, offer coupons, or get a phone call or email, without having a potential customer dropping off on the way to your website. For example, you can set up your business’s Facebook page template to one of 8, which include optimizations for Business, Services, Restaurants &amp; Cafes, and Shopping. Check out your page’s Settings, then go to Edit page to see your options.</p>
<p>Just remember, make sure you have someone (if it’s not you) monitoring your page for direct messages, post comments, and reviews. Social media is all about engagements and fostering relationships. That’s how you can make customer service work on social media – responding in real time. This makes it easy for potential customers to become repeat customers. The fewest amount of steps between fan to customer – with great service – the better.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #0074ff"><b>3. Are you posting content often enough?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The dreaded question. As a small business owner, you don’t want to spend time thinking about what you should post on your social channels each day. You want to run your business! As a best practice, you should post at least once a day, depending on the platform…but it doesn’t have to be brain-wracking or time consuming. Here are a few tips for posting on your small business’s social media.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, know that visual content is the best way to reach the majority of your fans organically (i.e., without spend). Take pictures and videos of your products, team members, and encourage your custcomers to submit content, as well. That’s called User-Generated Content, or UGC. You can screenshot good reviews and share those, or connect with local influencers or bloggers to write about your business, and as a thank you, you can share their content occasionally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Second, for the content that you do want to post, invest in a marketing budget friendly social media content management tool, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.agorapulse.com/"><span class="s2">Agorapulse</span></a>. You can <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/delegation-your-key-to-working-smarter"><span class="s2"><b>delegate a savvy team member</b></span></a> to take care of scheduling weekly content ahead of time if you are using multiple channels. (Facebook has its own scheduling tool built-in if you prefer to use that.) And it’s perfectly ok to re-share content every few months, especially if it already resonated with your audience. Good examples of this are daily hashtags like #ThrowbackThursday, or #TBT. Not only are you reusing content every Thursday, you are taking advantage of a trend and making your content searchable to the greater public.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #0074ff"><b>4. Are you taking advantage of your email lists?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you haven’t made the connection between your established audiences, you need to start that now! Uploading your customer lists and newsletter subscribers to your social media business pages is the best way to send cohesive communications across your marketing channels. Wouldn’t it be great to send a newsletter, a direct mail flier, and a social media ad with the same content? This shows coordination.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can also use uploaded email lists to reward current customers with a coupon…or even better, retarget customers or website visitors (make sure you have cookies on your site) who haven’t shopped in a while, or haven’t made that crucial first purchase.</span></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #0074ff"><b>5. Are you growing your email list on social media with lead generation?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is all great, you may say, but how do you grow your email list using social media? On Facebook, for instance, once your email lists are uploaded, you can create Lookalike audiences. What Facebook does is use what data is has about the emails you uploaded, and it finds other profiles like it. If ‘Customer A’ shops at your store, then ‘Lookalike Customer A’ might be interested in your product or service, too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to your email lists, you have the ability to create audiences based on interests, purchase behavior, geo-location, age and more. To best do this, think of your average customer, and what they are interested in. For example, if you are selling fly fishing paraphernalia, an interested audience would indeed be fishermen and fisherwomen, but you may also find that kayakers, canoers, hikers, and other people interested in outdoor activities will be interested in your products too. You can get as broad or as detailed as you want.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once you have that audience created, you can set up Lead Generation ads to collect emails from this group. Facebook has a very easy lead generation form where you can collect as much or as little information from your new lead as you’d like. Pro-tip: Less is more, but if you are selling fly fishing items, along with name and email, you can also ask questions about their favorite fly reel brand, or something specific to fly fishing. You can download leads directly from Facebook, or connect your CMS to Facebook so each time a person signs up, they automatically are added to your list.</span></p>
