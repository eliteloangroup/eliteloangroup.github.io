<p>Over the last 35+ years of my career, I’ve experienced the Holiday Bonus from both the employee’s and the employer’s perspective. There are many ways you might reward your employees at the end of the year for their hard work and contribution to your small business—which made us curious about how <em>you</em> did it. So we decided to ask.</p>
<p>Earlier this month we surveyed 509 small business owners to see what they did for their employees this time of year. Of the business owners who responded to the survey, 92% told us they offered their employees some kind of holiday bonus.</p>
<p>When I was a small business owner, I gave my employees a cash bonus. More than half of our survey respondents do the same—by far the most popular way to recognize employees with a bonus during the holidays.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-170701" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-10.43.20-AM.png?resize=800%2C365&#038;ssl=1" alt="Do you give your employees a holiday bonus | OnDeck" width="800" height="365" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-10.43.20-AM.png?w=1778&amp;ssl=1 1778w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-10.43.20-AM.png?resize=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-10.43.20-AM.png?resize=768%2C351&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-21-at-10.43.20-AM.png?resize=1024%2C468&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As an employee, there have been times when a holiday bonus just wasn’t part of the job, but I’ve been on the receiving end of all the following at one time or another:</p>
<ul>
<li>I give my employees a cash bonus (51.2%)</li>
<li>I give my employees a turkey, ham, or other item (10.1%)</li>
<li>Employees get a performance-based bonus before the holidays (9.9%)</li>
<li>I have a holiday party where cash and other prizes can be won (8.5%)</li>
<li>A performance-based bonus is incorporated into their compensation (3.6%)</li>
</ul>
<p>8.7% of the small business owners that responded do something else not listed by our survey; and 7.9% don’t offer a holiday bonus to their employees.</p>
<p>As a small business owner, I recognized how valuable my employees were to the success of my business. If I’d had a good year, the cash bonuses reflected that with a little extra. And, I considered the annual bonus a way to say thank you and spread a little Christmas cheer.</p>
<p>If there’s something we missed in our survey you are doing in your business, use the comments section to share your successes with us. We’d welcome the chance to learn more about what you do to spread holiday good will.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading our blog. All of us at OnDeck hope you have a wonderful holiday season.</p>

			<p>For many small businesses, the holiday season is one of the biggest times of the year and business owners recognize the need to stay focused to have a successful season.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separation between work and home lives is a myth for most small business owners. (You’re likely living proof of this constant battle.) Time is your most valuable possession and the holiday season makes the overwhelming demand of your time much more noticeable to you and to your family members. For many business owners, the holiday season can be your busiest time, while with other businesses it can be slower. Either way, you’re working hard to finish out the year on top and preparing your business for a strong year to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balancing this critical time of year for your business and with your family needs can be tricky. It’s easy for either your family or your business to feel neglected. It doesn’t need to be that way. I know there are a ton of time management articles out there (we’ve even written </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-101-ebook-take-back-your-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/3-unexpected-ways-business-owners-are-wasting-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but this is not a time management how-to. These are ideas and suggestions how you can keep your business running full steam ahead, while having meaningful time with your friends and family.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_170668" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170668" class="wp-image-170668" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getArticleMediaContent-1.jpg?resize=500%2C336&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="336" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getArticleMediaContent-1.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getArticleMediaContent-1.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getArticleMediaContent-1.jpg?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getArticleMediaContent-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getArticleMediaContent-1.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-170668" class="wp-caption-text">OnDeck&#8217;s NY office holiday party</p></div>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>At The Office</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping spirits high at the office is essential. It’s easy to get sluggish at the end of the year since everyone is focusing on family and the upcoming holidays. The end of the year is also a crucial time for any business. You want to be able to finish the year strong, and at the same time make sure that you’re not running yourself and your employees ragged. </span></p>
<p><strong>Here are some non-bank breaking ideas to keep distraction down and momentum up.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Give your employees a break:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Scheduling in some fun time throughout the upcoming weeks is a great way to keep everyone focused without seeming like a drill sergeant. As the boss, create a holiday-themed break for your employees. Have a bake-off, pick a date for everyone to sit down and have lunch together, do a white elephant or secret Santa. You don’t need to do all of these activities nor do they need to happen daily. These events will send the message that there is a designated time to play. Then you can all get back to work and make it happen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Show appreciation:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Very few things will make an employee feel appreciated by some type of bonus or company gift. You don’t need to go all out, but a little something shows you care and goes a long, long way to keep spirits high.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Run a contest:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nothing gets my blood pumping like a good contest. (I’m not afraid to admit I may be a little too competitive at times) Be it hitting a company related target or a light-hearted dance-off; it’s a way to bring your employees together for a fun treat.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Simplify the holiday party:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depending on the size of your company a holiday party could look very different. I’ve experienced a small party in the office, dinner at a restaurant, karaoke night (OnDeck’s favorite go-to activity). Many small businesses can’t afford to go all out for a holiday party, but don’t let that stop you from making one. Keep it casual, during the day, and keep it employees only. Doing something special for your company gives you and your employees a break from the norm. It can be just the thing to reinvigorate you and your employees for the rest of the year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Offer some time off:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all businesses are crazy busy during the holiday season. If that applies to you, give your employees some time back. Make Friday a half day, or let your best employees work from home one day. It won’t cost you a ton and it will mean a lot to have extra time to go gift shopping and prepare for the holidays with their families.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Give back:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get everyone into the holiday spirit and organize a way for you and your employees to give back. Maybe that’s volunteering together, organizing a food/coat/toy drive, or collecting donations to your favorite charity. This could also connect back to #3 and turn it into a contest with some prizes.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>At Home</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your family happy during the holidays is not that much different than keeping your employees happy. You will have to use different tactics to get you to the same place. Show your family you care by giving more of yourself.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Designate time:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have a significant other, kids, or living alone, giving time to your family is the most precious gift you can give this holiday season. All year your family supports you and your business and a big part of that is knowing sacrificing the time we get to spend with you. Designate 30 minutes every day to forgetting about your business and giving that time to your family. Spend more time with your kids, spouse, or simply call your parents, siblings, and grandparents. This small amount of time won’t negatively affect your business, and it will get majorly noticed by your loved ones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Put your phone down:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Out for drinks, having dinner, even having a conversation with involved the likelihood you’ll be interrupted by work. All year your family and friends put up with your phone in your hand 24/7 because we are your business’ biggest supporters. Give us a small break these next few weeks and put your phone down. (or at least turn it over)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Actually wrap your own gifts:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am excellent at gift wrapping. It’s one of the few areas I truly shine during the holiday season.  (I even took a class) I come from a big, close-knit family full of business owners, (my grandfather, my cousin, my aunt, my brother-in-law, and my husband.) nothing shows that you took time out of your day more than wrapping your own gifts. I know that my husband’s wrapping job won’t have perfect, handmade bows and multiple twists and folds in the paper, but I know he took the time to wrap it himself.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Plan a holiday movie marathon:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Plan a night to watch your favorite holiday movies. Get the popcorn, the candy, the whole nine yards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Build a gingerbread house:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don’t have little kids? Don’t fool yourself, everyone loves gingerbread houses! Even better, make it contest, see who can make the best one.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Bring the holiday cheer:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you haven’t gotten the hint by now, your time and attention is the big theme throughout this section. Do something extra around the house, cook a dish for the big family dinner, do the laundry (we’ll love you forever), pick people up from the airport, anything you can think of to make the lives of your loved ones a little more cheerful.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I don’t know you, your business or your family, these are just a few ideas that don’t require too much effort, but can go a long way in making your family and your employees feel appreciated during the holiday season. </span></p>

<p>You have your business plan, financial model, employment contracts and business processes in tip-top shape. Every person in your small business understands their role and your policies for their day-to-day work. But what happens when that all changes? You are expecting a new parent on your team and you&#8217;re not sure what you need to do to set up a maternity and paternity leave policy — and you haven&#8217;t even thought about what you&#8217;re going to do with one less person to get the work done. It might be time to create a parental leave policy.</p>
<p>Parental leave can be tricky for small businesses, but it is possible to survive and even thrive during this time. As a small business owner you need to know what you legally need to provide your employees in terms of leave as well as how to help your team adjust.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Benefits of Parental Leave</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to offer maternity and paternity leave to your employees. If you have 50 or more employees, you are required by law to follow the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and provide at least <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 workweeks of job-protected leave</a>. If you have fewer than 50 employees, you may not be legally required to provide FMLA leave. However, laws regarding parental leave differ depending on the state you&#8217;re in and you still have to abide by <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond legal requirements, having a parental leave policy is good for your small business. One of the most obvious and important benefits is employee morale. If your employees aren&#8217;t worried about losing their job if they have a child, they are more likely to return to work after their leave is up. This saves you time and money from having to interview, hire and train someone new. It also fosters a sense of community, teamwork and diversity within your business.</p>
<p>This time period also provides you with a good reason to cross-train employees and give them a chance to grow at the company. If you have an entry-level employee who is ready for the next step, this can be the perfect time to give them more responsibility and expand their skill set. It also sets you up to have employees who have a deeper understanding of your business and can fill in beyond parental leave, such as if someone else is sick, on vacation or called into jury duty.</p>
<h3>Devising a Plan for Parental Leave</h3>
<p>To help your small business thrive during parental leave, you need to come up with a plan. You should have a maternity and paternity leave policy in your employee handbook that spells out how much time they can take and whether it&#8217;s paid or unpaid. You also should decide if employees can work from home or flexible schedules leading up to their leave and when they return to work.</p>
<p>Once an employee approaches you about a pregnancy, adoption or foster child, you should work with him or her on a plan for while he or she is gone. Go over all of his or her responsibilities and daily tasks. Depending on his or her workload, decide whether you can split up the work between your existing employees or whether you need to hire a temporary worker.</p>
<p>Senior vice president of operations at Little Gyms Alex Bingham explains to Fast Company that his paternity leave helped his company <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3059873/how-small-businesses-can-afford-to-offer-paid-parental-leave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reassess their priorities</a>. They split up his workload between five employees and realized that they didn&#8217;t need to add eight hours per week to their current workload but rather look at their process and make it more efficient. He states that many companies do things simply because they always have and when low-priority items don&#8217;t get done and nothing bad happens it shows that maybe those tasks weren&#8217;t necessary to begin with. This example shows that you can look at your business process and each employees&#8217; responsibilities and come up with a plan for what&#8217;s really important.</p>
<h3>Hiring Temporary Employees</h3>
<p>As you&#8217;re creating a plan for parental leave, you need to consider everyone&#8217;s workload and time commitments. While parental leave can be a great opportunity for employees to step up and learn new skills, this isn&#8217;t feasible for all small businesses. If splitting up tasks is burdening your other employees or taking up too much time, you may need to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2015/10/14/5-tips-for-making-parental-leave-good-for-your-small-business/#7bf4f68f2b86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a temporary employee</a>.</p>
<p>Start building relationships with freelancers who may have the skills to take over certain job tasks for a set amount of time. For example, if you need writers, bookkeepers or graphic designers, you can find someone to complete those specific tasks. However, if you need someone with specialized skills, you should contact a temp agency to help you fill the role. Have the temp worker come in ahead of time to train with your employee who&#8217;s going on leave so they understand their role and responsibilities. The more they know ahead of time, the easier the transition will be for everyone.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to offer parental leave at your small business. By being prepared ahead of time, you and your employees will feel confident in their workload and you can figure out your business finances. Instead of thinking of parental leave as something you have to get through, consider it a great exercise for your business to improve efficiency, team building and morale.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Work/life balance is becoming more important to employees and  businesses have been working hard to beef up their benefits and perks. This can be a huge cost for small business owners, but don't worry! Here are some highly appealing benefits you can offer your employees without breaking the bank.</span></p>		</div>
		
<p>Employee perks have been a popular and important topic for business owners in recent years. With the rapid advancement of technology, employers have more options for the types of benefits they can offer employees. Instead of providing the same benefits that have been around for decades, such as health insurance, paid time off and sick days, you now need to consider extra perks that help you stand out from your competitors while keeping your budget and business needs in mind. Here are a few modern benefits that make sense and save you cents for your small business benefits package:</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Remote Work Opportunities</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">There are several pros and cons to letting your employees work remotely, but it can be a great benefit for your employees as well as your company. Some of the highly lauded pros are that remote work decreases absences, increases productivity and saves money. If employees come down with a cold, have a family emergency or are just feeling stressed in the office, they may take a sick day when it&#8217;s not really necessary. If you offer a work-from-home policy, your employees can work on their own time and deal with their work-life balance as they need to, meaning you still get your eight hours of work and your employees are happier.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">In terms of productivity, you should consider remote work on a case-by-case basis. Some employees work better in their chosen environment without the distraction of other employees, meetings, commuting and office politics. Simon Slade, CEO of Affilorama, tells Monster that job performance and satisfaction with his remote workers are about the same as his in-house employees, but he sees a <a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/the-benefits-of-working-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher rate of productivity</a>. However, some employees may find that their kids, chores and home setup doesn&#8217;t work for them. If your employees can concentrate better at home, this is a great benefit for both you and them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">One of the greatest beneficiaries of remote work is your company bank account. According to Global Workplace Analytics, about <a href="http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/resources/costs-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent of employers</a> say that cost savings are significant. You can save a lot of money on real estate and equipment for your office, even if your employees telecommute only part of the time. Alpine Access Remote Agents saw huge benefits to their finances by closing 30 percent more deals and decreasing customer complaints by 90 percent. In other words, giving your employees the option to work from home as a small business benefit could be a win for both of you.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Flexible Hours</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Offering flexible work hours has many of the same benefits as remote work. When employees feel like they have more control over their work and personal lives, they tend to be happier, healthier and more productive. As an employer, flex hours enable you to open up your talent pool to more people and compete with other companies for the best candidates. If you want to employ parents who need to drop their kids off at school at 7:45, allowing them to come into the office at 8:30 instead of 8:00 can make a big difference in their week. If you want to employ an individual who works better at night than in the morning, flex hours could boost their productivity. The more you help your employees decrease their stress and work to make them happier, the morale in your office will increase and so will your bottom line.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Offer Unlimited Time Off as Part of Your Small Business Benefits</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Unlimited time off has been making headlines for the last several years for both its pros and cons. Some argue that employees will take advantage of their PTO not being tracked, while others state that employees take less time off because they have to prove that they&#8217;re working harder than their co-workers. This has led to companies like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3052926/we-offered-unlimited-vacation-for-one-year-heres-what-we-learned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mammoth renaming this benefit</a> to &#8220;flexible,&#8221; &#8220;personalized&#8221; or &#8220;responsible&#8221; PTO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The key to this benefit is to make it work for your company&#8217;s workflow and culture. Unlimited time off shows your employees that you trust them to be responsible adults and that you value their work-life balance. When your employees have the chance to get away from the office to recharge and relax, they will come back refreshed and ready to work. Make sure your expectations and rules surrounding this policy are clear and that it doesn&#8217;t lead to all working vacations or abuse of the policy. If it works for your culture, you will be offering a competitive benefit that will lead to happier employees that stay with you longer.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Consider Winter Vacation for Small Business Benefits</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The end of the year is full of holidays, vacations and the scramble to take unused PTO days. Instead of trying to piece together your office, consider shutting down your office the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Day for a well-deserved break. Depending on your industry, a lot of your clients and customers will be busy with their families and the office will be pretty empty anyway, so why not treat your employees to some extra time off? In many industries, this is an expected part of the holiday season.</p>
<p>The modern small business benefits package isn&#8217;t all about a 401K or health insurance. As important as they are, they aren’t the only way to help your employees feel appreciated. When your employees feel appreciated and trusted, they will work harder for you. The happier they are, the happier you (and your bank account) will be.</p>

			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> A world class sales team doesn't just happen. Fostering an environment where a sales team can perform at its best takes some effort, but it isn't rocket science.</p><p>Building a high-performance sales team starts with who you hire—it's not enough to have people with great sales skills, they also need to be people who will fit and thrive in your company culture. When looking for sales talent, think about some of these things:</p><ul><li>Do they believe in the mission and vision of what your company is trying to do?</li><li>Are they team players who will help lift everyone's game?</li><li>What about integrity?</li><li>Do they have a "stick-to-it" attitude and personality?</li></ul><p>Sometimes sales professionals get a bad rap for being "coin operated" but a compensation plan that will enable them to see the financial rewards for their efforts is really only a part of the equation. Some of these other traits are just as important. Make sure you model the behaviors that are important to  you and your business. Keep reading to learn more about building a world-class sales team. </p>		</div>
		
<p>Growing up in a small business, from my earliest days driving the delivery truck, filling customer orders, or sweeping the warehouse floor, my dad ingrained in me, “We are all salespeople.”</p>
<p>“For many of our customers,” he would say, “you are the person many of them will see the most. Remember you’re representing our company every time you’re in front of a customer.” As a result, as I got a little older, it was probably no surprise to anyone that I would spend the first 10 years or so of my professional career in field sales—we called it outside sales at the time.</p>
<p>Although I’m not a salesperson now, when I met Patrick Morin (a person I’ve come to appreciate as a brilliant sales executive and two-time turnaround CEO), and he talked about building and motivating a world-class sales organization, I was interested in what he had to say. His experience includes building successful sales teams for small companies as well as large companies—but his approach to building a highly motivated team is pretty much the same for both.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his unorthodox approach might be a little counter intuitive. Although Morin suggests that sometimes it’s the top performers in the sales team that should find their necks on the chopping block first, it’s not their performance that puts them there.</p>
<p>I think many people (both employers and employees) would agree that company culture is a critical part of what makes a successful business successful. I’m convinced, along with Morin, that it’s a crucial part of keeping everyone motivated to perform at their best—and that includes the sales team.</p>
<p>A good culture rarely just happens. It starts with the type of people you recruit and those you eventually hire—which means you’ll need to identify the behaviors you value, and the traits you want to avoid.</p>
<p>“Most people want to contribute to something meaningful, something that will outlast their particular contribution,” said Morin. “Our job as sales leaders is to inspire our people with the vision—something that has them excited to start the workday every day.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some that never buy in to that vision. And, some actually become active detractors.</p>
<p><strong>“Buy In” to the Mission and Vision is Important</strong></p>
<p>Morin looks at his employees on a four-grid scale with “Buy In” on the vertical axis and “Performance” on the horizontal. When evaluating his sales team, along with future hires, he puts them into one of four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Buy In/Low Performance</li>
<li>Low Buy In/Low Performance</li>
<li>High Buy In/High Performance</li>
<li>Low Buy In/High Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Morin, I’ve been compelled to work with high-performing people who didn’t like the company, had no respect for our customers, didn’t work well with their colleagues, and continuously shared their discontent with anyone who would listen. “Like a cancer, a bad attitude spreads throughout an organization—while employees like that are otherwise recognized for high performance,” said Morin. “That would be the first person I fired.”</p>
<p>Buy in is that important.</p>
<p>He suggested that you might need to explain to the team why that person was dismissed, but most of the time, “It’s pretty obvious why a toxic employee is let go. You might even hear something like, ‘It’s about time,’” he said.</p>
<p>If you want your employees—including your salespeople, to know that engagement in the mission and vision of the company is valuable to you and your business, getting rid of the prima donna who feels he or she is above “buy in” could be the place to start. It should be no surprise that those with low buy in and low performance will quickly find the door, but the hard decision (and your employees see this) is showing the door to a high performer with a bad attitude.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens to the Rest of Your Team?</strong></p>
<p>When high performing employees that also buy in to the culture are recognized and promoted, when their performance is celebrated and shared throughout the business, these employees will step up when it’s crunch time and extra effort is required. What’s more, whether they are in official leadership roles or not, they likely have a leadership role with the rest of the team.</p>
<p>I once worked with a colleague who was described as the heart and soul of our group. She was a junior member of the team at the time, but her incredible attitude and willingness to go the extra mile, allowed her to take the lead in many situations. Her willingness to pitch in and fill whatever assignment she was given made her an incredibly valuable part of the team. She was a keeper I’d welcome on my team any day.</p>
<p>A high buy in person, but an under-performer is likely just in the wrong role or is being managed incorrectly. How long you work with someone in this situation is a matter for further thought, but buy in is a valuable commodity and shouldn’t be cavalierly squandered. I’ve personally witnessed employees like this respond to a different leadership approach, turn things around, and become top performers. I’ve also seen others do very well in a different role.</p>
<p><strong>A Motivational Culture Doesn’t Just Happen</strong></p>
<p>The value of building a successful sales culture is also shared by other sales leaders who are working to build a world-class sales team. “Building a strong culture on the sales team starts with who you hire,” said Paul Rosen, Former Chief Sales Officer at OnDeck. “We look for a lot of qualities but the two most important are: 1) integrity—without integrity, it doesn’t matter how otherwise talented you may be; you won’t fit on our sales team, and 2) resiliency—the ability to stick with it even when things get tough; and the fortitude to come back tomorrow to start all over again.”</p>
<p>Sales people often get a bad rap for being “coin operated.” In other words, only interested in the commissions they earn once they make a sale. I think that’s an unfair stereotype—at least for many of the most successful salespeople I’ve known over the course of my career.</p>
<p>Most people appreciate being recognized for top performance—your sales team is no different, and recognition is often what keeps them coming back tomorrow to do it all over again. “We recognize our top performers in front of their peers,” said Rosen, adding that this is often an under-appreciated approach to motivating an internal sales team.</p>
<p>“As a sales leader, it’s important to model the behaviors you value,” said Rosen. “If my sales team sees me doing anything contrary to the values we regularly talk about as important, it tells them they aren’t important to me—and they don’t need to take them seriously. They need to see, in my actions, the same work ethic I expect from them. Furthermore, the way I interact with them will reinforce the importance of acting according to our values when they interact with our customers and each other.”</p>
<p><strong>It’s Not <em>All</em> About the Money</strong></p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong; the opportunity to do well financially is a big motivation for most salespeople. Just remember, it might not be what keeps them coming back every day to use their sales skills for you and your company.</p>
<p>The right culture impacts the work you do, how you do it, and how your customers will respond to you and your team. In many ways, I think my Dad was right, everyone on the team is part of the sales team. The right culture will help you build and motivate a world-class team.</p>

<p>American small businesses are enjoying an overall positive uptick. As noted by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2016/01/17/the-state-of-u-s-small-businesses-entering-2016/#5d35f25b2acd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>, U.S SMBs entered 2016 with stronger sales growth, improved profitability and upward hiring trends. This doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise following a recessionary economy where both owners and employees are eschewing the notion of traditional stability and are instead blazing their own trail or leaving their unique mark on business culture. But here&#8217;s the thing: while a dream and the dollars needed for startup costs will get you on the road, staying the course for SMB success means cultivating the necessary traits to run the day-to-day operations of your business. Here&#8217;s a look at six skills you need for long-term effective operations.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">1</span> Find and Nurture Your Company’s Future Leaders</strong></h3>
<p>Business vision and strategy remain your top-tier priorities to ensure that your small business stays competitive, but ignoring the operations side of your organization will quickly sink any ability to gain market ground. As a result, it&#8217;s critical to nurture — or adopt — specific operational skills, starting with the ability to hire the right talent.</p>
<p>Think about it like this: despite your best efforts, you can&#8217;t do everything, all the time. Eventually you need a vacation, time off for health issues or childcare needs or to simply take a step back as the business expands. As a result, you need to develop effective hiring procedures that identify candidates with leadership potential. Don&#8217;t be afraid of social media — both Millennials and Generation Z search for jobs this way — and look to prioritize particular traits, which, according to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/282568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entrepreneur</a>, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local</li>
<li>Cost-effective</li>
<li>Passionate</li>
<li>Experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>Sussing out leadership potential, meanwhile, can often be accomplished through unique interview questions. For example, try asking candidates to solve a particularly difficult — or interesting — thought experiment. Give them a time limit and then ask about their answer. See what they say. What was their approach? Do they blame you for an unfair question? Were they thinking outside the box? This gives you solid insight into their character and how they handle the prevailing challenge of leadership: having to make unpopular or &#8220;unfair&#8221; decisions.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">2</span> </strong><strong>Work Toward Balance</strong></h3>
<p>Ideally, everything goes according to plan for your business. Funding is easy, sales ramp up steadily and you can quickly hire new talent. But the chances of this actually happening are, unlikely<em>. </em>You need to find the balance between patience and urgency. When do you stop to wait and see what develops and when do you need to make quick decisions that will ultimately make or break your business?</p>
<p>Your best bet here is delegation. Put the work in and delegate day-to-day tasks among trusted staff and then let them deal with any issues that arise. This keeps you from making hasty decisions based on knee-jerk reactions to standard business hiccups. For issues that fall outside the purview of your leaders-in-training, urgency may be required. Take them on a case-by-case basis and evaluate their impact to your bottom line.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">3</span> </strong><strong>Embrace the Stress of Running a Small Business</strong></h3>
<p>If you run a small business, you&#8217;re likely under a lot of stress. It&#8217;s the nature of the game and no matter how good you get at managing the component parts of your organization; it&#8217;s always there. As noted by <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/smbs-four-ways-the-cloud-can-reduce-your-stress-and-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZDNet</a>, it&#8217;s possible to reduce some aspects of your stress, such as the need for effective technology on a budget, by implementing cloud-based services that provide powerful computing services without the need for substantial tech know-how. But there are some stressors that come with being a small business owner — from opening a new location to rolling out online services or developing a new product — you can&#8217;t avoid to positively impact your market. If stress isn&#8217;t something that pushes you to be your best and helps you create or innovate, this part of operations can be incredibly taxing; it may be worth partnering with a provider or consulting agency to help share the burden.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">4</span> </strong><strong>Create a Culture of Accountability</strong></h3>
<p>Successful small business owners didn&#8217;t get there by chance — they earned their reputation from the ground up by being the best at what they do, understanding the market and setting critical goals. To ensure long-term business operations meet this same standard, you must be able to hold your team accountable for specific goals or to adopt new processes that will promote growth. <a href="http://www.business2community.com/small-business/3-essential-skills-for-successful-small-business-owners-01338914#gXqqJzQrVhkuk1t2.97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business 2 Community</a> puts it simply: SMB owners have the skill to sell their product, service and vision. This makes them experts, and makes them the standard-bearer for their entire organization.</p>
<p>As a result, you need to draft clear sales and service goals and hold your team accountable for their completion. While give-and-take is both positive and rewarding — new employees may have great ideas to help boost business — you get the first and last word. Get comfortable holding your team accountable to help drive success.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">5</span> </strong><strong>Be Prepared to Turn on a Dime</strong></h3>
<p>Things have changed. Suddenly the market you helped identify and build is undergoing transition, shifting away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing and socially-driven decision making. What do you do? One option is to double down and hope your reputation brings customers back, banking on your experience to carry the day. The bad news? Chances are you&#8217;ll get left behind. Instead, you must be ready to turn on a dime when the situation demands it and re-imagine your business model even if it means losing a perceived competitive edge. Think about it like this: your agility and passion got you into the market, and remains a critical trait to ensure effective operations.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">6</span> </strong><strong>Continue to Innovate</strong></h3>
<p>Take that thought a step further and you encounter the need to implement new processes and procedures as required. <a href="http://www.inc.com/murray-newlands/5-most-important-business-skills-every-entrepreneur-must-have.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inc.com</a> calls this skill &#8220;curiosity&#8221; — a curiosity about what your competitors are doing, what technologies they&#8217;re using and how other companies (both in your sector and outside it) are finding new customers.</p>
<p>For example, you might consider implementing a VoIP-based telephone service that lets you integrate traditional, computer-based and mobile phones, monitor calls and even implements enterprise-like automated answering services. Or it might be worth cultivating a more active social media presence to engage with customers in real time and discover what they&#8217;re looking for from your business. Another option? Bringing on new staff with new skill sets, such as the socially-conscious Generation Z, to keep your business current.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve done the work, put in the time and gotten your small business off the ground. Now it&#8217;s time to dig deep and adopt the operational skills you need for long-term success. Learn to look for leadership, find a balance as you manage stress, hold your team accountable and innovate to drive your business forward.</p>
