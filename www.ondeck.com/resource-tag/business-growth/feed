								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While you don&#8217;t need a business plan to run a business. Following a good business plan can mean the difference between achieving success and going out of business. Completing a written business plan actually <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/business-plan-success-twice-as-likely.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubles the chances of your business succeeding</a>. The survey results showed that business owners who complete written business plans are twice as likely to grow their business, secure investment capital or secure a business loan. Having a plan makes your business more attractive to investors and lenders because it shows that you’ve thought through your marketing, operational and financing strategy and you’ve actually crunched the numbers to show you’re a good credit risk. Here’s a guide to the components that go into <a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/district/mo/st-louis/resources/how-write-business-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a winning business plan</a> so you can make your business a success.</p>
<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The first part of a business plan is an executive summary, which provides a brief snapshot of your entire business plan. Your executive summary should cover the highlights of the other sections of your business plan, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your business description</li>
<li>Your design and development plan</li>
<li>Your operational and management plan</li>
<li>Your competitive analysis</li>
<li>Your marketing and sales strategy</li>
<li>Your financial projections</li>
<li>Your funding needs</li>
</ul>
<p>An executive summary should briefly cover each of these topics, devoting one or a few sentences to each topic over the course of a page or two. Subsequent sections of your business plan will expand on each of these topics in more detail. While an executive summary is the first part of your business plan, you may find it easier to write it after you have written your other sections, or you can write an initial outline of your executive summary and then flesh it out after you complete your business plan’s individual sections.</p>
<h3>Business Description</h3>
<p>Your business description should sum up who you are, what you do, how you do it, who you do it for, and why customers will pay you to do it. It should include answers to questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company name?</li>
<li>What is your business mission?</li>
<li>What problem does your company solve?</li>
<li>How does your product or service solve this problem?</li>
<li>Who needs a solution to your problem?</li>
<li>What makes your company’s solution stand out from that offered by competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will help you clarify your company’s identity and position you in the eyes of potential investors and lenders reading your business plan. It will also provide some background for the rest of your business plan.</p>
<h3>Design and Development Plan</h3>
<p>Your design and development section should describe your product or service. It should answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you sell?</li>
<li>What are the key features of your product or service?</li>
<li>What is your product lifecycle?</li>
<li>What are the key benefits?</li>
<li>What complementary products and services do you sell as upsells or cross-sells?</li>
<li>Do your products and services require any research and development?</li>
<li>Do you need any intellectual property protection such as patents or copyrights?</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will help you clarify the key sales appeal of your product and service line, as well as identify any development that needs to be done to bring your product or service to market.</p>
<h3>Operations and Management Plan</h3>
<p>The operations and management section of your plan lays out how your company is organized. It should address:</p>
<ul>
<li>What legal structure does your company use?</li>
<li>Who are your company’s key personnel, and what expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Will you need to hire any additional personnel with specialized skills, such as sales, design or software development?</li>
<li>What is the general workflow of your daily flow of operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will clarify how you plan to set up and run your company. It will also identify any hiring or outsourcing needs you have, which will be important for estimating your expenses when you do your financial projections.</p>
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>Your competitive analysis section sums up your market research. It should identify who is in your target market and how large your market is. It should also identify your main competitors and how you plan to compete with them to attract your target buyers. This section should answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people buy products and services such as yours?</li>
<li>How much do they spend?</li>
<li>Why do they buy?</li>
<li>Who are your main competitors?</li>
<li>What does the market want that your competitors aren’t delivering?</li>
<li>What will you offer that is different than your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your competitive analysis will provide a basis for developing your marketing strategy. It will also help you estimate your potential revenue, which will be important for writing the financial section of your business plan.</p>
<h3>Marketing and Sales Strategy</h3>
<p>The marketing strategy section of your plan builds on your market research by identifying the specific strategies and tactics you will use to reach your target market and persuade them to buy from you. It should cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing channels will you use to reach prospective customers?</li>
<li>What marketing themes will you use to attract prospects?</li>
<li>What sales process will you use to turn prospects into buying customers?</li>
<li>How will you turn customers into repeat buyers?</li>
<li>What will be the average value of a sale?</li>
<li>What will be the average lifetime value of a customer?</li>
<li>How much revenue will you generate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will help you think through your marketing and sales strategy and will demonstrate to investors and lenders that you have a viable plan to generate revenue.</p>
<h3>Financial Projections</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/business-plan-financial-section_pagen_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial projections section</a> of your plan should estimate your company’s key financials for the next three to five years. It should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income statements</li>
<li>Balance sheets</li>
<li>Cash flow statements</li>
<li>Break-even analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Your statements for your first year should be broken down by quarter or by month. This will give you a clearer idea of how much money you’ll have coming in, how much expenses you’ll need to cover, and how much additional capital you need to fund your business plan. This will also provide the numbers you need to convince investors and lenders of your business model’s viability and your funding needs.</p>
<h3>Funding Needs</h3>
<p>Your funding needs section lays out your request for any financing you need to close the gap between your current capital and your projected expenses. It should state:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much you need</li>
<li>What you need it for</li>
<li>What length of time you need it for</li>
<li>How you plan to pay it back or otherwise compensate investors</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is designed both to help you estimate your needs and to help you persuade investors and lenders to support you. To make this section more persuasive, you may choose to supplement it with visual aids or a video dramatizing your vision of your company and your funding request.</p>
<p>Your business plan outlines your company’s roadmap to success. Your plan’s executive summary provides a brief overview of your plan. The remaining sections of your plan detail who your company is, what you sell, how your business is organized, how you plan to compete, your marketing and sales strategy, your financial projections and your funding needs. Taking the time to write your business plan will improve your ability to attract funding and increase your company’s odds of financial success.</p>
<p>The best business plans are living, breathing documents that grow and along with your business. They are not a document you write and never look at again. Keep it handy so you can easily measure your success or change course before its too late.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Business Financing should be a part of any growth strategy discussion.

<p>This time of year many small business owners look at the next 12 months and make decisions about growth, how to pursue opportunities, and maybe even expansion plans. Unless they have the cash flow to fuel these business objectives, they also need to consider their options for accessing the capital they’ll need to find success.</p>
<p>Because, like their larger siblings, many small businesses rely on borrowed capital to fund growth and other initiatives, they should follow the example of larger companies that make funding business initiatives part of their annual strategic plan. With that in mind, here are three things you should consider as you put your plan together for the year:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evaluate your financial needs:</strong> It might not be enough to identify how much money you’ll need to fuel a new expansion or add a new product. You may also want to consider a timeline. Having six months vs. a few weeks or days to fund an important initiative can make a lot of difference in how and where you look, or the type of financing you seek. For example, if you need capital next month to launch an important initiative, an <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/sba-loans">SBA guaranteed loan</a> might not be an option because the approval process simply takes too long. On the other hand, if one of the loan guarantee programs is a good fit for your loan purpose and you have time to submit your application, go through the approval process, and wait for funds, it could be a great fit.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your business’ financial position:</strong> Although lenders might not ask it this way, most lenders want to know the answers to three questions: 1) Can you repay a loan? Will you repay a loan? And, will you be able to make repayment even if something unexpected happens? So in addition to the overall financial health of your business, you also need to be very aware of your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/business-credit">business credit profile</a> and your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/why-is-your-personal-credit-score-part-of-a-business-loan-decision">personal credit history</a>—because every potential lender will be and the options available to your business will be impacted by what’s in your profiles. If you, or your business, have a less-than-perfect credit profile, thinking in advance can help you take actions to improve in anticipation of a loan application in the months ahead. And, although you may not be able to create a perfect profile in a few months, being proactive today will help you make progress that could benefit your loan application down the road. Remember, slow and steady wins this race.</li>
<li><strong>What type of financing will best accommodate your strategy?</strong> There are numerous options for financing available today. Depending on your need you might consider a traditional term loan, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/short-term-business-loans">a short-term business loan</a>, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-equipment-financing">equipment financing</a>, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/working-capital-financing">working capital financing</a>, or a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/need-know-business-line-credit">business line of credit</a>. Depending upon the nature of your business or how long your doors have been open, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> may even be an option. I’m a big proponent of matching the nature of the financing to the business need. By making financing a part of your strategic plan for the year, you’ll be better able to find the best match for what you want to do and what’s available to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking these steps might not guarantee you’ll have access the funds you’re looking for, but taking this approach and incorporating a financing plan within your strategy for the year will give you a leg up over scrambling to find the financing you need at the last minute. The world of small business financing has changed a lot over the last few years and there are, at least in my opinion, more options available to small businesses than ever before. With that being said, business owners need to be more savvy and strategic when it comes to choosing the financing options that will best meet their needs.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about all the financing options available to your business, we’ve published, what we consider, a fairly complete <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/small-business-loans">guide to small business financing</a>. It talks about everything from SBA guaranteed loans to online loans, what some of the basic qualifying criteria is, where to apply, and how quickly you can access funds.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Budgeting business expenses can be a good way to accommodate the ebb and flow that takes place in most businesses through the year. Ramping up during busy times and anticipating the occasional lull helps many business owners stay focused on remaining profitable throughout the year.</p><p>Here are five things you can do to make budgeting business expenses easy:</p><ol><li>Don't put it off—create a plan</li><li>Stick to the plan</li><li>Establish benchmarks and goals</li><li>Stay on top of your customers to keep your AR where it should be</li><li>Start saving</li></ol><p>If you'd like to learn more about budgeting business expenses, keep reading.</p>		</div>
		
<p>Even if your business is not what is typically identified as a “seasonal” business, your business likely ebbs and flows with seasonal fluctuations—at least that’s been my experience over the last 35 or so years. Fortunately, after a couple of years at the helm of your business, those fluctuations can be anticipated; making it possible for a business owner to plan and budget accordingly.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Anticipate the Business Cycle</strong></span></h3>
<p>“Anticipate the business cycle” probably sounds like an oversimplification, but it takes discipline to know that the peak season will ebb, sometimes to a trickle, and you’ll need to at least tighten your belt a little once the peak is over. Preparing for those times when income lags (even if just a little), is an important part of running a successful small business.</p>
<p>Having spent many years in a seasonal business, it didn’t take long to recognize the importance of setting aside some profits today to pay for expenses during the lull before the next busy season. I also came to appreciate how critical it was to capitalize on the busy season—which usually meant more work, longer hours, and a lot more to do.</p>
<p>I noticed that during the peak times it was sometimes easy to rationalize spending a little extra, but it’s important to budget for your offseason expenses if you anticipate investing in your business when revenues are fat. This takes discipline and patience, but you’ll appreciate your budgeting restraint when the season is over.</p>
<p>Budgeting includes more than your capital resources, though. Many businesses reduce their business hours during the lulls between busy times; and some close their doors altogether. Reducing staff is another consideration and should be addressed whenever new employees are hired so they understand if are times when you regularly scale back staff—and what that will mean for them.</p>
<p>You might also be able to minimize business expenses by negotiating with your suppliers for a “just in time” approach to managing your inventory. In other words, if your suppliers maintain a sufficient inventory for you to access during peak times, you won’t have to carry the expense of maintaining that inventory once the peak has subsided. This will likely require you to take a more strategic approach to managing your inventory, but it could help you better budget throughout the year.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5 Things You Can Do to Make Budgeting Easier</strong></span></h3>
<p>In addition to anticipating the business cycle, here are five things to consider as you plan for the future:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t put it off—create a plan:</strong> Look at the next twelve months with the business peaks and valleys in mind. Create a strategy and a plan for how you will prepare for the slack times when revenues are good. Your strategy will help you stay focused in the heat of battle.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to the plan:</strong> If budgeting for future expenses is an important first step and creating a plan is the second, you will need to stick to the plan for it to be successful. I’m not convinced that means a rigid adherence to a plan if situations change, but make sure you consider the plan and the ramifications of deviating from it in those situations.</li>
<li><strong>Establish benchmarks and goals:</strong> Poor cash flow management is one of the biggest causes of small business failure, so establishing practices and strategies for properly managing your cash flow should be a priority. Make sure you’re on top of your <strong><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/financial-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash flow metric</a></strong> and consult with your accountant CPA if you’re not sure of the best approach to take.</li>
<li><strong>Stay on top of your customers:</strong> If you bill your customers by invoice and offer them 30 days to pay their bill, it doesn’t very long for a slow-paying customer to eat up all the profit you may have had—making your busy season less profitable and putting the slower times at risk. To speed things up, you might offer your customers an additional discount to pay today or have a credit-card on file you can charge against at the end of the month. The goal is to avoid the inevitable cash flow challenges associated with slow-paying customers. The quicker you have access to that cash flow, the easier it is to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Start saving:</strong> Setting aside a little cash for a rainy day doesn’t just apply to your household budget. There are a lot of unexpected business expenses that could be addressed with some money in the bank. A good goal to shoot for is three to six months of operating capital, but anything is better than nothing. Some of the smartest business owners I know regularly set aside some of their profits to ensure they have at least a three- to six-month cushion should something unexpected happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we get ready to start the next year, there isn’t a better time to take a <strong><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/end-year-checklist-small-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look at how you did this year</a> </strong>and project a budget forward based on this years results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every so often I have the pleasure of meeting small business owners who dazzle me with the inventiveness of their products, passion, business know-how, and their desire to share that know-how with other small business owners. Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking with the winners of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/ondeck-seal-of-approval-winners">OnDeck’s Seal of Approval</a></span></span> contest; Rachelle and Paul Baron founders of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a target="_blank" style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://beauandbellelittles.com/">Beau &amp; Belle Littles</a></span></span>. The Barons have the perfect storm of a great product, great marketing, and sales skills, and that type of determination only entrepreneurs possess to make their business successful.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;"><strong>About Rachelle and Paul</strong></span></h3>
<p>Paul is a born entrepreneur, with over a half dozen businesses under his belt starting from childhood when he would take his drawing to the grocery store and sell them. “My sales pitch was pretty great, I would ask, “would you like this?” and if they said yes, then I would say, “then that’ll be $0.05.” Most of the time it would work!” Since his first endeavor, he’s been a landscaper, a videographer, and he ran a full-service digital marketing shop doing web development, design, and marketing… just to name a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rachelle received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Northern Colorado in French, which believe it or not, she has actually used to communicate with some of their Canadian customers. (Side note: my dad was also a French major, but he never used it to do anything productive. I love you, dad!) Most of Rachelle’s professional background is in retail, and her experience with running a customer service based business has helped her immensely.</p>
<p>Together, their backgrounds make them a great team and have been extremely beneficial in helping Paul and Rachelle grow Beau and Belle Littles to what it is today.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">Ariele Krantzow, OnDeck: How did the idea of Beau &amp; Belle Littles begin?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul Baron, Beau &amp; Belle Littles:</strong></span> The idea for Beau &amp; Belle Littles came from wanting to have a business so we could help Rachelle make her own schedule because she wanted to be able to stay home with Beau. The idea is all Rachelle actually, I like to think that I’m the entrepreneur in this relationship but she’s really the smart one. When Beau was about 6 months old we were given our first reusable swim diaper, which was made by one of the biggest national brands in baby swimwear. At the time we didn’t even really know that reusable swim diapers existed, but being frugally-minded people we decided to give it a go. Rachelle hated it. <strong>HATED</strong> it. It was supposedly 6-12 month sized but it was SUPER tight around his little legs and we didn’t like how if he did end up pooping in it we’d have to pull it off like underwear, thus pulling the poop all down his legs. Because of this, we were basically forced to use disposable diapers, which neither of us really liked.</p>
<p>Our son, Beau loves water, if that kid could live in a pool or a bath, he would. Because he likes water so much we were blowing through disposable swim diaper and we got really, really tired of wasting money. So we decided to keep looking for reusable options. In our search, we really didn’t find any in the marketplace that we thought were good enough. We thought it would make much more sense to have a one-size-fits-all type swimming diaper rather than the single-sized reusable swim diaper we were given. Furthermore, we wanted it to be both cute and functional. Nothing like that really existed at the time so we decided to investigate making some ourselves.</p>
<p>One thing led to another and it went from just having a few cute swim diapers for Beau and his little friends to eventually manufacturing and selling reusable swim diapers. In July 2015, we launched our very first product on Amazon the Nageuret Swim Diaper. The word Nageuret (pronounced nah-jour-ay) is French and roughly means small/little swimmer. We were absolutely blown away by the reception of our swim diapers, people <span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>LOVED</strong></span> them just as much as we did, and they started selling really, really well in a very short amount of time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> This is a good question. Since the bulk of my experience in running different businesses has always been the service-based business arena, I think one thing that I would have liked to have known is a little bit more about is inventory planning and inventory projections. For example, we were just recently out of stock for 12 days which represented a loss of about $6,000 for one specific product. Knowing how to balance income and revenue with inventory purchasing would be and still is crucial to our success.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle Baron, Beau &amp; Belle Littles:</strong></span> I wish I knew how hard it would be to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/is-financing-business-growth-a-good-idea-for-my-business">find capital</a></span></span> for a business that has no history. That’s been our biggest setback and we have run out of inventory several times because we just didn’t have enough money to order in time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: So, now you have a great product, how did you start getting people to buy it?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong> </span>Initially we asked our friends to try it so that we could see if it was a good product and when they liked it we used Amazon as a launching platform. Using Amazon is nice because they have a lot of traffic already and you don’t have to find traffic you just have to know how to leverage it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">Paul:</span></strong> Amazon to validated that we had a good idea. And to be completely honest we were sort of blown away by the reception our products had. I remember thinking in September 2015, which is technically two months after we launched, that we would sort of plateau at about $8,000 per month in revenue from our two SKUs that we had selling. I was really wrong! By July 2015, with only two skews selling online we hit $50,000 in revenue for just that month. I was absolutely blown away!</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: Besides Amazon, how did you start marketing your products? What tactics have you had the most success with?</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">Paul:</span></strong> Our Amazon traffic validated our idea, people really loved the Nageuret, so we knew that we had a hit. Our next task was then to begin really driving traffic and sales to our website and increase our brand exposure otherwise. We rely heavily on social media and great press. Because we have such a unique product and we have such a great brand with a good story we have been able to get in several blogs, in some pretty cool magazines, and on several “best of lists,” online and on a few different tv shows; and of course winning the OnDeck Seal of Approval Contest was huge for us!</p>
<p>Right now I’m really in love with influencer marketing, in fact, I’m in developing an app to help make that process a little bit more automated and easy for us, so that’s pretty cool. I’m excited to see how it turns out and I may even monetize that once it’s working for us. Another thing that’s actually pretty cool and has helped us is actually entering contests. There are all kinds of different business contests that you can enter and it’s amazing how many we’ve entered that we are either finalists in or actually one. Obviously, OnDeck is one shining example of a great contest that we won. Another that we were actually finalists for was “emerging business of the year,” presented by the US Chamber of Commerce. We just got back from Washington DC for that award ceremony and we recognized nationally as one of the top 3 emerging businesses in the nation out of hundreds of nominees. This award was cool because we had a chance to meet with our congressman, Jared Polis, who is himself an absolutely incredible entrepreneur. So to sum it up, those three things: influencer marketing, great press, and winning business contests all have a very symbiotic relationship in that they give us great exposure and great organic marketing and have done volumes for our brand.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong></span> To add to that, the people who buy our products primarily are mommies and they spend a lot of time on social media, especially Instagram. So we put a lot of effort in finding mommy bloggers and influencers on Instagram to get our word out. We grew our Facebook following from 400 people to 4,000 in a little over three months just using tools on Facebook and in addition to Facebook Ads.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: Many small businesses are family run, what do you do to keep business and family separate, or can you?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> Oh man this is an absolutely great question! This is really, really difficult actually. One thing that Rachelle and I do is we have a rule that Sundays are our day off. We really do our best to make sure that we don’t do any business at all on Sunday. We try not to even look at our email and we really try not to even talk about the business. That’s more difficult than it may seem though. Since both she and I run the company together, we’re both very passionate about it, naturally we tend to talk a lot about it just in general even when we’re not actually “in business mode.” This is something that we’re still working on, and as the company grows and we had more processes and structure to it I feel like it’s getting a little bit easier than it has been in the past. But like all things in life, I think the key to this is intentionality and making sure that you have distinct boundaries and goals…goals I’m great at, boundaries I’m terrible with; it’s the rebel entrepreneur child in me, haha!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: You won the OnDeck Seal of Approval contest and spoke with Barbara Corcoran, What’s the best advice she gave you and how has your business grown or benefitted from her guidance?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> For me, I think my biggest takeaway from the meeting with Barbara is just trusting our gut more. She really impressed me as just being extremely bright, she’s obviously an amazing businesswoman and one of my personal role models as an entrepreneur. What she’s accomplished is absolutely tremendous and I really value the input that she gave in regards to trusting our gut and making sure that we stay true to our vision. One really cool thing, for me anyway, is in watching shark tank she kind of has this look that she gives people when she’s about to invest in them or make them an offer. During the Forbes interview when Geri Stengel was interviewing her and Rachelle, there was a point where Rachelle was answering a question—I can’t remember which one exactly, but Barbara just kind of sat back and looked at Rachelle and had that “I’m going to make you an offer look,” and I could tell that she saw something in Rachelle. That made me extremely proud (did I mention how I married way above my pay grade?). It was funny actually because Barbara said something to the effect of how she would rather do business with Rachelle over me because Rachelle went with her gut instinct or something like that. I thought it was funny because I was sitting in the room listening to the interview &amp; taking photos for Social and Barbara didn’t even realize that because I was just being quiet watching, I thought it was hilarious!</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: How did you invest your $10k prize from OnDeck? Have you seen any ROI from that investment?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> We put it straight in the inventory!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong></span> We launched a new pattern with the $10,000 that we got from the OnDeck contest and it’s actually our bestseller.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> We have a pretty decent profit margin on our products so we saw about a $5,000 return on it when all was said and done.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> I was actually looking at these numbers last night and because we’ve just entered our third year of business we’re able to track our year-over-year and month-over-month growth. So, I look at it on a per SKU level as well as overall growth. Tracking it per SKU, I’m able to see which items are the hottest selling and which items need a little bit more love in terms of marketing efforts. One of the hardest things about that is sometimes a product may have reached the end of its life cycle, so to speak. Trying to figure out if you just need to market that product harder or to remove it and add in a different item is a little bit difficult sometimes when just analyzing raw data. But so far this year on average, we have grown 200% over last year. A lot of that we attribute to the amazing press we received from OnDeck and the advice that we’ve gotten from Barbara Corcoran.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of Beau &amp; Belle Littles?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> I’m super stoked about being able to hire people and expand our product lines and product offerings. When we were in DC for the US Chamber of Commerce Emerging Business of the Year award I mentioned a few things that could really help <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/expand-my-small-business">grow our business</a></span></span>. One of which, could actually be almost considered as a pivot for our company in terms of a product offering, which I’m really excited about.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong></span> We are hoping to launch a few new patterns for our swim diapers, a larger size that can even fit kids that have special needs and aren’t potty trained. There’s a huge gap in the market there for cute or fashionable products. We have been working with someone on getting a start in the Australia also.</p>
<p>At Beau &amp; Belle Littles, our goal is to make the absolute best reusable baby products on the market. We have had absolutely amazing feedback from mommies (and daddies) all over the country that absolutely love our swim diapers. Because of this success, we plan to expand our product line to include different lines of baby and toddler swim and swim-related products between 2017 and 2019; all while keeping our Nageuret line of swim diaper as the cornerstone of our product lineup.</p>
<p><strong>I want to leave you off with this inspirational thought Paul had when talking about all the businesses he’s started:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Most of the businesses I started were failures, but the great thing about failures is that as long as you don’t let them identify you as a “failure,” and rather you look at them as learning experiences, then those experiences/lessons that you learn in those failures helping more on your path towards success than almost any other lesson would.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
