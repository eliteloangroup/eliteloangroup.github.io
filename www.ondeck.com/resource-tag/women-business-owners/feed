								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To wrap up Women Small Business Owners month (my favorite month of the year), the women of OnDeck wanted to give back to the undeniable force that is the growing group of intelligent, fearless women taking on their dreams and starting their own businesses. We&#8217;re excited that over the past 11 years, <a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/files/doc_library/file/2018-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of women-owned businesses surged 58%, while all businesses increased only 12%</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because investing in your success as business owners is why we wake up every morning, the female leaders at OnDeck wanted to pass along their advice, which helped them get to where they are today in their own careers.</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">The burden of proof, so to speak, on women is higher, so:</span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">Make sure your numbers are detailed, comprehensive and that you know them inside and out.</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">Create your own board of directors to ensure you have people who can give you advice, additional perspective, etc.</span></li></ul><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">—<strong>Andrea Gellert</strong>, Chief Revenue Officer</span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p><span class="s1">Have confidence in yourself that you can figure out how to accomplish what needs to be done, even if you haven’t done it before.  There is a now-famous and often-quoted Hewlett Packard internal report released several years ago stating that “men apply for a job when they meet 60&#037; of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100&#037; of them.” Women often assume they need expertise in something to do it well, when the fact is, they’re pretty good at figuring it out!  Triangulating a few relevant past experiences and some good old intuition will usually get you there.</span></p><p style="text-align: right"><span class="s1">—<strong>Shannon Smith</strong>, </span><span class="s1">SVP of Marketing</span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #0074ff;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">When we talk to successful and stable small businesses they all have very different ways of managing their businesses, but one thing they seem to have in common is that they set aside some of their earnings into a separate account to help them weather hard financial times. Doing this seems to help these small businesses survive past the notorious “5 year” mark.</span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span style="color: #ffffff"><span class="s1">—<strong>Tracey Varnell</strong>, </span><span class="s1">Director of Design Strategy</span></span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t worry about trying to do everything perfect and celebrate small wins… success is about the journey!</span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span class="s1">—<strong>Kelly Merrill</strong>, </span><span class="s1">SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis</span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #ffffff">Cultivating mentors that you admire and respect is critically important<span style="color: #ffffff"><span class="s1">—</span></span>but don’t expect amazing mentors to just fall into your lap. You have to be proactive. </span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span style="color: #ffffff"><span class="s1">—<strong>Christin Spradley</strong>, </span><span class="s1">Head of External Affairs &amp; Associate General Counsel</span></span></p>		</div>
		
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leverage your strengths such as empathy, listening skills, or emotional intelligence, that are typically slated as skills where women outshine men, as a differentiator for your business and customers.</span></p><p class="p1" style="text-align: right"><span class="s1">—<strong>Rudmila Rahman</strong>, </span><span class="s1">Director of Financial Institution Partnerships</span></p>		</div>
		
<p>Thank you to all the women small business owners who work hard every day. We look forward to continuing to serve you.</p>
