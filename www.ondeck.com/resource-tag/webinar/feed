								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growth is the only option for most small businesses. Either you&#8217;re growing or you&#8217;re losing business. Very few small businesses maintain the status quo year after year. Some years will have slower incremental growth, while  other years you plan to create large step growth. Often, these larger growth goals require capital and if your businesses is <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-finance-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready for the next big step</a> you may have considered financing growth for your business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Missed our live webinar?</strong></span></h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #333333"><strong>We discussed the<span style="color: #0074ff"> 5 financial metrics</span> every small business owner should be looking at.</strong></span></h3>
<p>You don’t need to be an accountant or a small business financing expert to run a successful business, but there are a handful of metrics every small business owner should be very familiar with. Most of the metrics are pretty straightforward and logical, but I’d like to share them with you and some insights I’ve gained over my 35 plus years in small business. I’d also like to point out some of the mistakes I made as a business owner that might help you.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Click on the video to watch it now!</strong></span></h3>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOXCe0q0iWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a">We talked about:</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">1</span>. Income</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">2.</span> Expenses</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">3.</span> Cash Flow</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">4.</span> Accounts Receivables</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">5.</span> Accounts Payables</strong></p>
<p>I often made the mistake Michael Gerber, author of The E-Myth Revisited, describes as working “in” my business instead of working “on” my business. In this webinar we’ll talk about how paying attention to these five metrics will help you work “on” your business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we teamed up with our <a href="https://www.score.org/content/search/all/658,265/all/72/10669?page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small business education partner SCORE</a> to provide an insider’s view into the new world of business lending in a live <a href="https://www.score.org/workshops/insiders-view-securing-capital-grow-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webinar</a>. Ty Kiisel, contributing editor at OnDeck, spoke to nearly 300 live listeners to demystify the new landscape of small business lenders. He covered the five major types of online lending: non-profit lenders, crowdfunding, invoice financing, online business loans (that’s us), and loan matching sites.</p>
<p>While I’m partial to OnDeck as a lender (of course), Ty emphasized that not all lending options make sense for all businesses and it’s important for business owners to understand which type of financing makes the most sense for their situation.</p>
<p>To help business owners understand where to start their search for financing, Ty presented a four-question checklist:</p>
<ol>
<li>What type of financing can I qualify for?</li>
<li>Which options are the best fit for my business?</li>
<li>How much money do I really need?</li>
<li>Do I have all the information I need to make a decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>Any business owner looking for financing should take this checklist to heart. It doesn’t matter if you have great, or less-than perfect credit, or if your business is a startup or established business. With all the new types of lenders that have surfaced, you will have financing options. Understanding your options and how each fits into your business’ needs are critical when making financial decisions.</p>
<p>For more information on any of the lending types listed above or to hear more of Ty’s advice check out the <a href="https://www.score.org/workshops/insiders-view-securing-capital-grow-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded webinar on the SCORE website</a>.</p>
