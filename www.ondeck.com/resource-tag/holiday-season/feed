								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans are notorious about leaving vacation days on the table. According to a 2018 article posted on the CNBC web portal, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/3-reasons-americans-wont-take-a-vacation-this-summer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of 1,000 survey respondents</a> polled by Bankrate did not plan to take a summer vacation. While half of those respondents cited lack of money, 22 percent claimed they could not take time off from work. It’s true that after returning from a relaxing vacation, returning to a high-stress work environment and a mountain of work can be a shock to the system. You may even feel like you need another vacation to recover.</p>
<p>If taking additional time off isn’t viable, that doesn’t leave you without options. The five strategies listed below can protect your mental health during the transition from vacation mode to the everyday work routine and beat the post-vacation blues.</p>
<h3><strong>Ease Back into the Routine</strong></h3>
<p>It’s unrealistic to expect to hit the ground running immediately after returning from a vacation. Instead, ease back into the routine while paving the way toward getting back into gear. If possible, come in a day before your planned return to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/harmoncullinan/2017/06/29/three-strategies-to-avoid-the-post-vacation-blues/#3d520edd1948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort through unread emails</a> and written materials. Divide them into two categories: “To Do” and “To Wait” so that you’ll know what to address first once you make your official return to work.</p>
<p>Refrain from overfilling your work calendar for the first few days after coming back. Especially avoid the temptation of jumping into a series of meetings right away. Instead, block off time in your calendar to meet individually with key colleagues — especially those who have covered for you while you were away. You should also set aside time to return phone calls, respond to emails and correspondence in your “To Do” category and catch up on other urgent matters.</p>
<h3><strong>Take Breaks Throughout the Day</strong></h3>
<p>One of the purposes of a vacation is to relax, distress and recharge. It’s natural that your mind will still be in vacation mode when you first return to work. Rather than dismiss this mindset, utilize it during scheduled meditation breaks throughout the day. According to an article in Psychology Today, imagining yourself in a location where you experienced enjoyment yields <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-tapas/201003/post-vacation-blues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beneficial neurological effects</a>.</p>
<p>Meditation does not have to be elaborate. You don’t have to sit cross-legged on your office floor and chant if you would feel awkward doing so. It’s sufficient to lean back in your chair and close your eyes for a few moments. If possible, leave your work area entirely and step outside for sunshine and fresh air.</p>
<p>Your colleagues may be curious about your vacation, and you may have dozens, if not hundreds of great photos and memories. Why not share a few with your colleagues — perhaps at lunch or briefly before scheduled meetings. Unless you and your coworkers are completely under the gun, this is a great way to extend the enjoyment of your vacation for a few days longer.</p>
<h3><strong>Anticipate Future Time Off</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you love what you do, taking breaks is essential. One way of ensuring that vacations are a viable option is by planning ahead. According to “The State of American Vacation 2017,” a report produced by Project Time Off, <a href="https://projecttimeoff.com/reports/the-state-of-american-vacation-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent of workers</a> who actively plan their vacations actually wind up taking all their allotted time off — versus just 40 percent of non-planners.</p>
<p>The first days of returning from your vacation represent an ideal time to plan your next period of time off from work. Even if you can’t pull off another full-fledged getaway right away, the anticipation of a long weekend a few weeks or months down the road can be enough to get you through those long, tedious meetings or endless piles of paperwork. You’ll be amazed by the benefits to your mental health.</p>
<h3><strong>Incorporate Your Vacation into Everyday Existence</strong></h3>
<p>Post-vacation letdown can give you a case of the blues. Especially if your time off was spent in an exciting or exotic location, your everyday existence can seem humdrum in comparison. Why not incorporate some of the aspects of your vacation into your regular routine? If you enjoyed eating delicious foods from another cuisine, include some of those items on your next grocery trip. These days, many grocery stores include extensive ethnic food sections. You may even have specialty stores in your location. Other commodities, such as clothing, writing papers, magazines and music can add a touch of vacation variety into your everyday life.</p>
<h3><strong>Recharge with Family and Friends</strong></h3>
<p>Numerous research studies have shown that prolonged isolation tends to feed depression. While you may be too busy at work to resume a regular social calendar right away after returning from vacation, avoid the tendency to get bogged down with work for weeks and months after your return. Instead, surround yourself with family and friends by scheduling fun activities or simply to decompress from the pressures of your work.</p>
<p>Your budget may be stretched thin after taking time off. Nonetheless, it’s important to make plans for fun during evenings or regular weekends, such as get-togethers with friends. Nothing elaborate or costly is necessary — a potluck dinner or an evening watching a DVD is an inexpensive way to reconnect with the important people in your life.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Back!</strong></h3>
<p>Planning for the time after your return from vacation can avoid the pitfalls of the post-vacation blues. Doing so can help preserve the benefits of rest, relocation and time away from work, and help you be more productive once you return.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the holiday season comes to a close, it’s normal to feel a little burnt out. No matter which industry you’re in, it can seem like a mad dash to the end of the year. For business owners, there’s more than enough on your plate with your regular day-to-day tasks and </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/have-this-year-be-your-best-year-ever"><span style="font-weight: 400">planning for the coming year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are 3 ideas to help you wind down after the holiday season ends:</span></h3>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Catch up with friends and family:</strong> No one close to a business owner is immune from the time commitment necessary to run a business. Take a few hours and catch up with friends and family. Make sure to let them know you appreciate them and their support.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Take a day to yourself:</strong> As a business owner you’re often giving your time to your business, your employees, and you give the leftovers to your family. Take a day and do what you want to do (with or without other people) go to a movie, go for a hike, get a massage, workout, or just plain do nothing. Leave work and the pressures of the year to come at the door for a day, and you’ll be surprised how good you’ll feel. </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Make a list of the “fun” things you want to do in the next year:</strong> As the wife of a small business owner, I find that if we write something down, it’s more likely to happen. We keep a list of fun activities we’d like to do together and somehow as the year ticks by we cross things off. (Pro tip: hang the list in a visible spot.)</span></li></ol>		</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As colder weather approaches, individuals and companies alike begin thinking about and planning for the holidays. If you’re among the many business owners who plan to celebrate the holidays with your employees, you’re in good company. You’re also engaging in a smart business practice. As it turns out, celebrating the festive season not only increases good will around the office or factory floor, doing so is good for the company’s bottom line.</p>
<h3>Workplace Satisfaction and Job Performance</h3>
<p>As a businessperson, you may recognize value in keeping your workers happy. Employee turnover is expensive, not to mention disruptive. However, maintaining employee satisfaction also helps your company’s bottom line in boosting productivity. In fact, studies cited by the Harvard Business Review showed that companies experienced <a href="https://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/examining-the-relationship-between-workplace-satisfaction-and-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31 percent more productivity</a> and 37 percent higher sales when employees were happy or satisfied.</p>
<h3>Why Holiday Entertainment Spending Pays Off</h3>
<p>At the height of the Great Recession, many companies cancelled so-called extras such as holiday bonuses and parties. In fact, only <a href="https://www.omaha.com/money/at-least-some-company-holiday-parties-make-a-comeback-after/article_f5713b5c-cdff-5f65-bc57-f009b80c345c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent of companies</a> responding to an annual survey conducted by Challenger, Gray and Christmas in 2011 planned to hold holiday parties. By 2015, the number of companies that planned to host holiday festivities had rebounded to 80 percent.</p>
<p>There’s a good reason for the upswing. Holiday entertainment spending demonstrates that the hard work and effort employees put in is appreciated. The money spent on holiday parties, bonuses and gifts can be viewed as an investment in maintaining stability among your company’s workforce. Workers who feel appreciated are more willing to put in extra effort when needed and less likely to be shopping around their résumés to look for new jobs.</p>
<h3>Best Practices for Spending the Holiday Budget</h3>
<p>There are five major elements of any get-together: guest list, venue, food and drink, ambiance and entertainment. Many big companies splash out on big-ticket celebrations during the holidays, including celebrity entertainment, all-expense-paid getaways to exotic locations or lavish feasts featuring dancing accompanied by live music and open bars.</p>
<p>However, it is not necessary to break the bank to throw an enjoyable holiday party. If your budget is limited, you can either opt to cut back expenses overall, or limit some areas while splashing out on others. For instance, holding the holiday celebration on company premises incurs few or no additional expenses. However, logistics may be a challenge if your company is large or you plan to host spouses, vendors and others along with your employees.</p>
<p>The guest list for a holiday party is often determined by the nature of the celebration. In-house lunches are often limited to employees, while employees often expect to be allowed to bring spouses to evening events held over dinner. Adding vendors and other non-employees to the guest list also increases costs.</p>
<p>The tab for food and drink for a holiday celebration can be as inexpensive as a potluck lunch or as extravagant as an all-expenses paid, multi-course sit-down dinner along with an open bar and a live band for dancing. Entertainment for holiday parties can also translate into major expense. As a rule, live entertainment is more expensive than pre-recorded tracks spun by a deejay. Ambiance and lighting are often neglected. Fortunately, creating an inviting ambiance is often as simple (and inexpensive) as strategic lighting and well-placed, unobtrusive speakers.</p>
<p>If you intend to serve alcohol at your holiday party, it’s smart to minimize the risk of partygoers driving home while intoxicated. Reserving a block of hotel rooms is a generous option, especially for parties held off premises. Complementary rides home by cab or shared-ride service is a somewhat less expensive option that accomplishes the same purpose.</p>
<p>If your holiday party budget is more generous, an evening celebration where spouses are invited and which features live entertainment and a sit-down meal may be viewed as more memorable by employees. On the other hand, a limited budget does not mean limiting the fun of a holiday party. A catered lunch allows a welcome opportunity for downtime and camaraderie among employees, and between workers and supervisors.</p>
<p>Invitations represent one aspect of a holiday party that involves little or no cost. Online sites such as Evite allow hosts to create secure, private sites for their celebrations, with customized invitations distributed via email or text, and running tabs of acceptances and regrets.</p>
<h3>In-Office Versus Offsite Parties</h3>
<p>In-office parties are often more convenient, especially for lunchtime celebrations <span class="fr-style">—</span> after all, your workers are already there. Parties on company premises also tend to be less formal and more relaxed, which often suits the culture of smaller companies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many larger companies opt to host their holiday festivities offsite, especially if alcohol is served. Many offsite venues include provide food and drink, covering two aspects of your company’s holiday celebration. Offsite celebrations signal that the get-together is social, rather than an extension of the workday, and lend themselves to more formal celebrations.</p>
<p>Informal holiday celebrations provide opportunities for employees at all levels to relate to one another in a relaxed atmosphere. Secret Santa exchanges with preset spending limits or outings to see a popular family-friendly movie are fun ideas for smaller companies. Planning a date to serve meals in a soup kitchen honors the spirit of the season while providing a means for companies of all sizes to give back to others who are less fortunate.</p>
<h3>Tax Implications of the Holiday Party</h3>
<p>While the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated several formerly-allowed entertainment-related tax breaks, some deductions for company holiday parties were left intact. Specifically, hiring a popular entertainer for an evening to entertain vendors is probably no longer eligible for a tax break. However, expenses for parties held for employees and spouses (except for “highly compensated employees”) likely remain 100 percent tax deductible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you love them, hate them (or regard them with complete indifference), holiday celebrations are an undeniable reality of many company cultures. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas — when the silly season hits, work life can seem like a relentless parade of tinsel, paper plates and sensibly casual slacks.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, why do we do it? Do these celebrations serve a deeper purpose? Or are they best simply gotten rid of when the company budget gets tight? Most importantly, if we do keep the holiday traditions, how do you get the best bang for your buck on a limited budget?</p>
<p>Here’s our take on these holiday imponderables.</p>
<h3>Why Have Holiday Celebrations at All?</h3>
<p>It’s a fair question. Let’s face it, while there are going to be <em>some</em> people in any company who live for the next corporate shin-dig, a lot of people regard these events with something approaching disdain. The fact is, arguments about opportunity cost and corporate austerity aside, holiday celebrations are just a very human thing to do.</p>
<p>Sure people might gripe about it, but it brings people together. They provide an opportunity for colleagues to step away from the daily grind and just … hang out as people. It’s an emotional rationale sure, but there’s nothing wrong with celebrating the fact that we aren’t just faceless work droids from time to time.</p>
<p>Setting the feely, touchy stuff aside though, there’s also a very tangible reason holiday celebrations are a good thing. They reinforce loyalty and cohesion and they improve engagement.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup analysis</a> of workplace productivity found that companies with a highly motivated and engaged workforce outperformed rival companies by 147 percent in earnings. Flipping that coin, <a href="https://risepeople.com/blog/employee-engagement-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the estimated cost</a> of a disengaged workforce is between $450 and $550 billion, annually.</p>
<p>Are holiday celebrations the magical ingredient which makes engagement happen? Well, no. However, they are definitely one small part of what keeps people together and motivated to be part of a greater whole.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>holiday celebrations are important, even if you’re on a tight budget.</p>
<h3>Holiday Celebrations on a Budget</h3>
<p>So, if you buy the argument that we shouldn’t dispense with them altogether, how can we make holiday celebrations worthwhile when money is a limiting factor?</p>
<p>The key here is to keep the company eye on the collective prize. Building loyalty and engagement is the goal here &#8211; <em>not </em>opulence or (brace yourself) “optics”.</p>
<p>Here’s three ways to make that happen.</p>
<h4>1. Reinforce a Sense of Kinship</h4>
<p>A holiday celebration is an opportunity to recognize the <em>human</em> experience of working within the company. This needn’t and shouldn’t be heavy handed.</p>
<p>It can be as simple as managers mingling not with a view to “networking” and instead opening up conversations about highs and lows. What was fun these last few months, and what … well … sucked.</p>
<p>On a slightly more nuts and bolts level, getting all staff (rather than the dreaded party committee) involved in decorations and music can be a great way to build a sense of kinship while simultaneously saving costs on DJs and catering. Win win!</p>
<h4>2. Get People Talking</h4>
<p>Making a holiday hootenanny an opportunity for everyone to speak and be part of a conversation also reinforces the idea that we’re all in this together. Again, this needn’t be organized or choreographed. In fact, only the most die hard of extroverts among us likes big group “ice-breakers”. Most introverts hate them.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t find structured low-key opportunities to get people talking. Tables could be set up with trivia or other questions, for example. The room can be set up in a way which encourages different sets of people talking. Managers could even try to introduce people who might not normally talk to one another.</p>
<p>None of this costs money. It just requires encouraging folks to open up.</p>
<h4>3. Be Inclusive</h4>
<p>To build loyalty, it isn’t necessary to wow people with lavish options. But you do need to show that you’ve listened to their preferences. Being sure to give participants the opportunity to express their tastes, dietary restrictions, and family requirements is a big step toward showing them they’re genuinely welcome and valued. In fact, it’ll likely go a lot further than fancy appetizers and drinks with umbrellas.</p>
<p>Getting the best bang for your buck from a holiday celebration may be as simple as spending a bit of time up-front identifying what people <em>actually</em> want, rather than pulling the trigger on a fancy caterer or opulent event location.</p>
<h3>A Few Things to Avoid</h3>
<p>It’s probably worth mentioning a few things to avoid if you’re trying to create a fun and inclusive holiday celebration on a budget.</p>
<h4>1. Avoid Lots of Alcohol</h4>
<p>Most would agree a bit of drinky goodness is fine, but a lot is a) expensive and b) unlikely to produce a memorable experience. Instead of using alcohol as a social lubricant, focus instead on creating a fun and relaxing environment. Good music and good food go a long way!</p>
<h4>2. Don’t Make It Too Formal</h4>
<p>If you do have seating arrangements, find an opportunity to mix it up. Generally, we tribal humans have a tendency to stick within our own cliques. The more formal and structured the party, the more likely that is to happen.</p>
<p>Comfortable, open seating is way better. Make the chairs movable! The more movement and informality you can introduce the greater the likelihood the party will have a life of its own rather than be a stifled, corporate affair.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the cheaper the venue the more likely this is to happen. Lavish party venues tend to breed an air of everyone having to be respectful of the layout. A cheaper party venue or casual home environment reinforces the idea that you can relax and enjoy yourself.</p>
<h3>Try Not To Make It About Work</h3>
<p>This is a tough one! Sure, it’s a work function, but people have plenty of time to talk about work during office hours! It’s a good idea to keep the party a work-announcement free zone.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of a corporate holiday celebration on a limited budget may require a little extra versatility to organize. However, it’s also a great opportunity to focus on what counts.</p>
<p>After all, loyalty and engagement aren’t bought with fancy catering! They’re a result of listening, inclusion and showing that we’re all in this together. And all that good stuff is 100% free.</p>
<p>Happy Celebrating!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not just a Holiday party – a soirée could boost your business profits, too. A study by BrightHR found fun at work increases productivity, reduces absence and lowers levels of stress. Employees who have fun at work are more likely to report feeling committed to their organization and more likely to report feeling creative at work, and they&#8217;re <a href="https://pages.brighthr.com/it-pays-to-play-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to take sick days</a>.

<p>Throwing the best company Holiday party ever requires thoughtful planning. Here are some tips for putting on a holiday event for your business that employees will remember fondly for years to come.</p>
<h3>1. Plan Your Budget</h3>
<p>Ideally, this step will have happened at the beginning of the work year, so you ensure you have enough to spend come holiday party planning time. You&#8217;ll want to take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of attendees, including if you&#8217;ll allow employees to bring a guest or entire families to the party</li>
<li>Venue</li>
<li>Food and drink options</li>
<li>Decorations</li>
<li>Entertainment</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit.com recommends budgeting at least <a href="https://blog.credit.com/2013/10/office-holiday-party-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$75 per person</a> for a work holiday party. To save money, you can choose to have a holiday party at lunch or on a non-weekend night. You could also work with vendors you have a relationship with to nab a discount, skip an outside venue and hold the party at your office, use an iPod for music instead of a DJ, or implement a whole host of other budget-friendly holiday party ideas.</p>
<h3>2. Ask Employees for Input</h3>
<p>Make employees feel like they&#8217;re a part of the party-planning by asking them what they want at the party. You can use a free survey creator like <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Forms</a> to send out some questions regarding the planning, including the best time to host the party, employee guest policies and venue suggestions.</p>
<p>You should definitely ask for employee feedback regarding the menu. Your employees may have certain dietary restrictions or preferences, so having diverse food that everyone will enjoy is key.</p>
<p>You may also find that familial obligations influence what type of party your employees want. For example, if most of your employees have kids, they might want a party at a kid-friendly venue, so they can save money on having to hire a baby-sitter if they want to attend.</p>
<h3>3. Scope Out Venues</h3>
<p>Where you have your party can make or break its success. Some venues will have professionals working for them to take care of decorations and set-up, while others will give you free reign to decorate (which also might save you money). When looking at venues, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much seating you need</li>
<li>How central the location is compared to where the majority of your employees live</li>
<li>Space for entertainment, like a dance floor or DJ</li>
<li>How the venue can accommodate decorations for a specific theme</li>
</ul>
<p>Some small businesses choose to host a festive get-together at the office. If you are considering this, and you&#8217;re hosting the party during work hours where attendance is mandatory, you must pay your employees for attending the Holiday party.</p>
<p>Also, be aware, if you serve alcohol at an office Holiday party, you open your business up to liability. If an employee is injured at work, you will likely be facing a worker&#8217;s compensation claim. You should take your workplace alcohol guidelines into account when planning any Holiday party, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<h3>4. Determine the Presence of Alcohol</h3>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.millealawfirm.com/workplace-holiday-parties-employer-responsibilities-and-worker-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 percent of businesses</a> will experience an employee lawsuit at some point, according to the Millea Law Firm. Don&#8217;t let your Holiday party put employees or your business in danger. Whether or not to serve alcohol is a key consideration. You want to make the party festive but keep it safe, so keep these factors in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t let employees get drunk &#8211; </strong>One way to avoid this is to work with a licensed alcohol provider. Bartenders should not serve employees who appear intoxicated. You might want to hand out a set number of drink tickets or host a cash bar so employees drink less.</li>
<li><strong>Arrange for transportation &#8211; </strong>You might not be able to get cabs for all your employees, but you could arrange for a discount code for a ride-sharing service like Lyft or Uber. Or, choose a venue that is close to public transportation. If you see that an intoxicated employee is leaving and plans on driving home, call them a cab.</li>
<li><strong>Only serve beer and wine &#8211; </strong>Mixed drinks, or something like spiked punch, make it harder for employees to determine just how much they&#8217;re drinking. If you limit what you serve to beer and wine, it&#8217;s easier to monitor how much alcohol is being consumed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To protect your business further, at any party where you&#8217;re serving alcohol, make it crystal-clear that the party is not mandatory and that no business will be conducted during it. You can have employees sign a waiver where they agree they are liable for their behavior and will accept appropriate consequences, so they&#8217;re more likely to monitor their alcohol use.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Make It Fun and Festive </strong></h3>
<p>If the holiday party is purely for employee enjoyment and not to do any business, make that clear to employees. Include games and activities at the party to help employees break the ice and get to know coworkers they may not interact with regularly. You could also host a raffle with prizes employees are interested in, so they get excited about winning and look forward to the results throughout the party.</p>
<p>Another way to spread cheer at your Holiday party is to set up a photo booth with props. Your employees can take a memory of the party home with them and get creative in their mini-photo shoots.</p>
<p>You also might want to consider a recognition portion for your Holiday party, though it&#8217;s important to not make any employees feel excluded. You could choose silly award themes to avoid competition or bitterness. Or if your team is small enough, you could hand out a meaningful award to every single team member.</p>
<p>Remind employees of office etiquette guidelines before the party kicks off. Employees should be discouraged from bringing questionable gag gifts to a party, or something like mistletoe that could make coworkers feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Once the party is over, send out another survey asking employees what they thought of it. Their responses can help you plan better for next year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> There are a few ways to show appreciation for your employees at the end of the year. For a small business, holiday bonuses are an option, but it's not the only way. </p><p>In this article we'll talk about the pros and cons of holiday:</p><ul><li>Bonuses</li><li>Gifts</li><li>Parties</li><li>Time off</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>&#8216;Tis the season to show your employees you care. The holiday season bring out the warm and fuzzies no matter which holiday people are celebrating. If you want to join in on the fun and strengthen your relationships with employees, some type of holiday reward can help.</p>
<p>Gallup research finds employee recognition positively impacts employee engagement when the recognition is honest, authentic and individualized. (1) So what&#8217;s the best type of way to recognize employees over the holidays? Here&#8217;s a look at the pros and cons of bonuses, gifts, parties and time off when you&#8217;re considering what your business can offer.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Bonuses for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Holiday bonuses can be based on employee performance or given out at the same amount for all employees. A 2017 report by ABC News found up to 70 percent of employers offer performance-based bonus plans, and 35 percent of U.S. employers offer across-the-board holiday bonuses. (2)</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Bonuses<br />
</strong>When a bonus is performance-based, it can motivate employees to meet the performance standards needed to secure the bonus. Some companies measure performance throughout the entire year before deciding bonus amounts. These types of bonuses can be a powerful way to keep employees performing well throughout the entire year.</p>
<p>Knowing that a bonus is coming can increase employee morale. The National Retail Federation reports consumers will spend an average of more than $1,000 this holiday season. (3) Anticipating a chunk of change that will help alleviate that burden is something employees can look forward to around the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Bonuses<br />
</strong>If you give a bonus one year, employees might come to expect them each following year. If you have to reduce the next bonus or do not provide it in the future, employees can become angry or let it affect their work performance going forward.</p>
<p>Bonuses that are based on performance can also create some negative feelings. For example, if an employee doesn&#8217;t think the bonus they received is deserving of the effort they put forth, they might feel negatively about it. Performance-based bonuses might also create unhealthy competition or resentment among coworkers.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Gifts for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Holiday gifts for employees allow small business owners to get really creative with how they recognize their employees over the holidays. There is no limit on what types of gifts to give, from elegant office-friendly gifts to gift cards.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Gifts<br />
</strong>If you buy certain types of holiday gifts in bulk, you might be able to get a discount. You can also leverage connections you have for gift ideas and potential save money, too. For example, if you&#8217;re friends with a store owner or restaurant owner, they might be willing to give you gift cards for a lower cost.</p>
<p>Some employees might really appreciate gift cards, because they can help with their own holiday shopping or give them the freedom to pick out a gift for themselves they&#8217;ll really love.</p>
<p>If you give personalized gifts, that can make more of an impact on employee engagement, because you&#8217;re showing employees you pay attention to the kinds of gifts they&#8217;d like. A great gift can have the potential to be more meaningful while costing less than some other employee holiday recognition options.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Gifts<br />
</strong>Employees who embrace a minimalist lifestyle or who are already overloaded with the amount of stuff in their homes may not appreciate a gift.</p>
<p>The wrong type of gift could make a negative impact. For example, you might think a beautiful journal is a cool gift for an employee, but the employee may interpret the gift as something meant to be used for work and assign less meaning to it. (4)</p>
<p>You could also even get into dangerous territory with some gifts, like if you give a bottle of wine to an employee who doesn&#8217;t drink alcohol, or you give peanut butter cookies to someone who is allergic to peanuts or is gluten-intolerant.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Parties for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Some employees look forward to an annual holiday party, and others (introverts, ahem) dread them.  The 2018 <em>Holiday Party Survey </em>of 150 human resources representatives across the country found 65 percent of companies plan to host holiday festivities, which is the lowest percentage since 2009. (5) Some possible reasons the report cites for the decline include liability issues regarding sexual harassment and assault at holiday parties, as well as increasingly remote workforces.</p>
<p>No holiday party is fine for employees who get some other form of holiday compensation, since a 2017 survey of more than 1,200 people by Randstad US found 90 percent of workers would rather get a bonus or extra vacation days than attend a company holiday party. (6)</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Parties<br />
</strong>A holiday party is a way for your employees to connect. The Randstad survey found 62 percent of employees feel pressured to attend a company holiday party, so if you want to have a team bonding event where people are likely to show up, this is a good one to host.</p>
<p>Holiday party programming allows for employee recognition in front of employees&#8217; friends and family, which can be really special for employees (or, on the other hand, really embarrassing.)</p>
<p>Planning a holiday party enables your business to connect with other local businesses who might provide services like a venue and catering. This could widen your network in your business community.</p>
<p>A holiday party where employees feel comfortable sharing more of themselves with their coworkers can strengthen bonds back in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Parties<br />
</strong>Holiday parties involving alcohol present challenges. Some employees may not want to come or will not enjoy themselves if alcohol is not present. However, any work event where alcohol is served opens your business up to liability. (7)</p>
<p>You must have alcohol policies in place, including for work events outside of the office. You could make the bar a cash bar where another vendor serves the alcohol, and instruct bartenders to not serve alcohol to visibly intoxicated guests. You could also provide security at any event where alcohol is served and tell employees not to return to the office or use office equipment after drinking.</p>
<p>Seeing employees who are intoxicated is another issue. You have to be prepared for employees behaving differently if they are drinking. Remind them before the event of how that will influence your and their coworkers&#8217; perception of them back in the workplace.</p>
<p>Holiday party costs can add up quickly if you are renting a venue and paying for food, drinks and security. If an employee or employee&#8217;s guest damages a property the blame could be placed on your business and damage its reputation.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also have to be careful when planning the party theme. Your employees might celebrate diverse holidays, so creating an all-inclusive party can be challenging based on diet and which holidays are celebrated.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Time Off for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Time off is the most desirable reward for employees, according to the Randstad survey, which reports 70 percent of respondents named time off as the number one thing they wanted from employers. Time is money, after all, and during the holiday season, there never seems to be enough time to do all we need to.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Time Off<br />
</strong>While hours or a day off does technically cost your company, it might be less of a hit since other employees can pick up the slack when an employee is gone.</p>
<p>One way to prevent all your employees from taking the same time off around the holiday season is to give time off to be used the following year. This way, all your employees aren&#8217;t gone all at the same time. If your business tends to get slower in the holiday season anyway, you could also consider letting everyone leave a few hours early before the holiday, or adding an extra day or two on to the typical holiday leave.</p>
<p>Since most employees want time off, when you give it your staff, it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ll feel gracious for this gift. Time off is universally useful.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Time Off<br />
</strong>Your business may already be generous in how much time off you give. Giving more could place a burden on your operations.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t regulate when employees can use the time off, there&#8217;s a chance you might receive multiple requests for similar times.</p>
<p>If you give time off and employees want to use it during a busy time when you need them in the office, denying multiple requests could result in resentment.</p>
<h3><strong>What Gift Will You Give Your Employees This Holiday Season?</strong></h3>
<p>The type of holiday employee recognition that is most cost-effective and meaningful for your business will depend on a variety of factors, like your employee preferences, your business model, and your budget.</p>
<p>Some type of recognition is vital to give, though, since it boosts employee engagement. Businesses with engaged workforces are more profitable, have fewer accidents, have better customer engagement, and have better productivity and retention compared to those that don&#8217;t, Gallup reports. (8)</p>
<p>Try surveying your employees before the holidays about what type of recognition they&#8217;d want the most. You can host an anonymous survey using a tool like Google Forms to gain insights. (9) When you pay attention to what employees want and then deliver it, you&#8217;re giving more personalized and effective holiday recognition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If last year&#8217;s retail trends were any indication, small business holiday sales in 2018 may hit an all-time high. The most significant factor contributing to the 6.2% year-over-year retail sales growth was <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/01/final-2017-holiday-sales-figures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robust online sales</a>. Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, was the biggest retail shopping day of last year&#8217;s holiday season in the U.S., while additional days like Cyber Monday and Small Business Saturday gave the growth a push.</p>
<p>As a small business, you can best taken advantage of the sales opportunities over the holiday season by preparing early. From marketing strategies to in-store experiences, here are some ways your business can increase your profits over the holidays.</p>
<h3>Determine Which Sales Days to Invest In</h3>
<p>Your industry and business model will dictate which days during the holiday season your brand would benefit from focusing on. If you&#8217;re a completely online business, Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, is a crucial day to capture customer attention. If you&#8217;re a brick and mortar with strong ties in the community, Small Business Saturday, or the Saturday after Thanksgiving, is a great time to promote your local roots and tie in a community partnership as you plan. Knowing that Black Friday is the top holiday retail sales day for businesses in diverse industries, some sort of focus on this day should also be considered.</p>
<p>Your clientele demographics can help to drive your marketing initiatives. If you sell family-friendly products, emphasizing that your products make great gifts for holidays like Christmas can work for your brand. The U.S. Small Business Administration recommends hosting an <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/7-holiday-marketing-tips-limited-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open house-type event</a> before the major holidays hit, so you can give a preview to customers of what you&#8217;re offering and leave them with a special offer to use over the holidays.</p>
<h3>Devise an Editorial Schedule Focused on the Holidays</h3>
<p>Using your business blog and social media channels to promote holiday specials gets your followers excited and prepped to shop with you. As you develop your holiday business strategy, create an editorial calendar to accompany it that includes content you&#8217;ll create to support your sales efforts, as well as social media postings. The calendar can also include influencer or blogger campaigns that can help to extend the reach of your marketing efforts.</p>
<p>You might consider a content campaign that ties into a holiday theme, such as &#8220;12 Days of Specials,&#8221; where you offer a new discount each day for the 12 days leading up to a holiday. A Twitter party chat that ties into your products, which features a branded holiday-themed hashtag, can also get people talking about your brand on social. If you use social media advertising over the holidays, create ads that feature products that are targeted to the same demographic the ads are being shown to.</p>
<h3>Safeguard Your Online Store</h3>
<p>If you sell online, it&#8217;s vital to prepare for an uptick in online sales over the holidays, especially on Cyber Monday. Entrepreneur<em> </em>magazine recommends trying out new things with your website <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240268#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far before the holidays</a> hit, so you can fix any bugs and optimize accordingly. Conduct a speed test on your site, and make sure that it can handle up at least 200 percent more traffic than you&#8217;re currently getting. Small businesses lose an average of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/it-downtime-costs-%24265-billion-in-lost-revenue/d/d-id/1097919?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$55,000 in revenue each year</a> due to IT failures. Don&#8217;t let the holidays cause a major hit to your business.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also imperative to conduct thorough security checks in your e-commerce store and throughout your site. In 2016, e-commerce fraud risk <a href="http://multichannelmerchant.com/news/ecommerce-fraud-risk-79-holiday-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased 79 percent</a> year-over-year during the holiday season. Make sure your business does not store sensitive customer data, follows all PCI compliance regulations and uses tokenization and end-to-end encryption to protect personal information during transactions.</p>
<h3>Increase Store Foot Traffic</h3>
<p>The holiday shopping season is one a lot of shoppers look forward to because of the special holiday-themed atmosphere many stores create for shoppers. Passerby who see a busy store may be enticed to check it out, as well, which is why it&#8217;s so important for your store to be bustling during the holidays. To get more people in your store, consider ideas like:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #83eece;">
			<ul><li><span style="color: #000000">Feature live entertainment, such as a musician, carolers or face painter for kids</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000">Offer promotions that are in-store-only</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000">Keep people in the store longer by speaking to the senses, such as by handing out hot chocolate or using scent technology to make scents like cinnamon or peppermint pervasive throughout your store</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000">Host a contest or raffle where participants must be present to win</span></li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>While you want tons of people in your store during the holiday season, you also want to make sure visitors feel calm and comfortable in your store. Consider opening up the layout to allow for more space to travel throughout the store, or add a pop-up extension outside your store for special items.</p>
<h3>Improve Upon Previous Efforts</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been in business for previous holiday seasons, looking at trends and what worked and what didn&#8217;t work in previous years is key to getting a head start on a better strategy this year. You can also use analytics data from your website visits and overall sales data to gain insight into what products you want to highlight over the holidays, or to help drive product innovation and the creation of special holiday gift sets.</p>
<p>This season is also a prime opportunity for your business to show off your stellar customer service and product policy. Make sure your support team is responsive on your website and social media channels, and offer an easy-to-understand return and shipping policy to make it easy for customers to be confident in your brand. Your sales team should be prepped for an increased amount of customers and teams should be staffed accordingly.</p>
<p>Like any time of year, aim to serve and thrill your customer, and to make their holiday season enjoyable rather than stressful. By helping customers with discounts on products they love or by offering entertainment for their kids when they&#8217;re shopping with you, you can increase not just sales, but loyalty to your brand. Make sure to monitor and measure your efforts this year, so you can keep improving in the future, too.</p>
