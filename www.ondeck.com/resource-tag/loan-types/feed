			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Although the SBA isn't the largest source of borrowed capital for a small business, many businesses think of SBA loans when they contemplate borrowing to fuel growth, expand, or finance some other business initiative. Before you apply, there are a few things you need to know about SBA-guaranteed loans. The first thing you need to know is that the SBA isn't actually a lender—most SBA loans will come from your local bank and are guaranteed by the SBA. The guarantee is designed to make it easier for the bank to approve a loan to a borrower whose credit worthiness might fall just below the normal qualifying criteria at the bank.</p><p>There are also a number of different loan types, depending upon the business or the business loan purpose, you'll need to know before you apply. The most common loan types are:</p><ol><li><strong>The 7(a) Loan:</strong> The most popular and flexible SBA loan product</li><li><strong>The CDC 504 Loan:</strong> A popular loan used to finance fixed assets like equipment or real estate</li><li><strong>The SBA Microloan Program:</strong> This loan program is designed for very small loans (under $50,000) for new and growing businesses</li><li><strong>The Disaster Loan Program:</strong> A loan designed to help business owners recover from damage or loss caused by a natural disaster</li></ol><p>An SBA-guaranteed loan can be a good option for those businesses that qualify—we'll talk about some of the qualification criteria as well as what to expect as far as interest rates and fees are concerned.

<p>Although the SBA (U.S. Small Business Administration) isn’t a lender, it has guaranteed millions of small business loans since it was established in 1953. SBA loans are offered by participating banks, credit unions, and a few specially-licensed non-bank lenders. The SBA loan guarantee program was created to encourage lenders to work with more small businesses that might otherwise struggle to access capital. The guarantee programs adhere to specific lending terms, interest rate caps, and other criteria outlined by the SBA.</p>
<p>Because a small business loan is considered a higher-risk loan, to reduce that risk to the lender, the SBA will frequently guarantee <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Quick%20Reference%20Guide%20to%20SBA%20Loan%20Guaranty%20Programs.pdf">50% to 85%</a> of an eligible loan (within their 7(a) loan program, for example). In effect, sharing the potential risk with the lender, which enables more small business borrowers to access capital from traditional lending sources through the SBA Loan Guarantee Program.</p>
<p>Because the SBA doesn’t act as a direct lender, it’s the banks and other participating lenders who decide whether or not to approve a loan application. Upon loan approval, application is made to the SBA for the guarantee.</p>
<h3><strong>SBA Loan Types</strong></h3>
<p>The SBA offers several different guarantee programs—here are a few of the most popular:</p>
<h4><strong>The 7(a) Loan</strong></h4>
<p>Probably the most popular loan program is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/sbas-7a-loan-program-explained">7(a) loan</a>. This guarantee program is designed to fit a broad range of financing needs and is the option of choice for many small businesses—with some restrictions. Some of the basic uses of an SBA 7(a) loan could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term working capital to pay operational expenses, accounts payable, or to purchase inventory</li>
<li>Short-term working capital, including seasonal financing, contract performance, construction financing, and exporting</li>
<li>Funds for purchasing equipment, machinery, furniture, fixtures, supplies, or materials</li>
<li>Real estate, including land and buildings</li>
<li>New building construction or renovation on an existing building</li>
<li>Funds to establish a new business, contribute to the purchase of an existing business, or expand an existing business</li>
</ul>
<p>SBA loan programs do have restrictions. For example, funds guaranteed by the SBA <em>can’t</em> be used for investing or purchasing a building that will be leased to another business. They also can’t be used to reimburse a business owner for money previously invested in the business by the owner or to repay money owed to the government.</p>
<p><strong>Is Your Business Eligible for a 7(a) Loan?</strong></p>
<p>If you operate a small business in the United States or any of its territories, have some capital of your own to invest in your business, and are current with all debt payments to the U.S. government (including your income taxes), you may be eligible for an SBA loan—<em>unless</em> your business falls into one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/lender_notices/5000-1322.pdf">ineligible businesses</a> identified by the SBA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Businesses engaged in the business of lending, such as banks, finance companies, payday lending, some leasing companies, and factors.</li>
<li>Businesses owned by developers and landlords that do not occupy the assets acquired or improved with the loan proceeds (except when the property is leased to the business at zero profit for the property owners)</li>
<li>Life insurance companies</li>
<li>Businesses located in a foreign country (businesses in the U.S. owned by aliens may qualify)</li>
<li>Businesses engaged in pyramid sale distribution plans, where a participants primary incentive is based on the sales made by an ever-increasing number of participants</li>
<li>Businesses deriving more than one-third of gross annual revenue from legal gambling activities</li>
<li>Businesses engaged in any illegal activity</li>
<li>Private clubs and businesses that limit the number of memberships for reasons other than capacity</li>
<li>Government-owned entities</li>
<li>Businesses principally engaged in teaching, instructing, counseling, or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs, whether in a religious or secular setting</li>
<li>Consumer and marketing cooperatives</li>
<li>Loan packagers earning more than one third of their gross annual revenue from packaging SBA loans</li>
<li>Businesses in which the lender or CDC, or any of its associates owns an equity interest</li>
<li>Businesses that present live performances of an indecent sexual nature or derive directly or indirectly more than 2.5 percent of gross revenue through the sale of products or services, or the presentation of any depictions or displays of an indecent sexual nature</li>
<li>Businesses primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities</li>
<li>Speculative businesses (such as oil exploration)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interest Rates</strong></p>
<p>The interest rate you pay is negotiated between you and the lender—subject to SBA minimums and caps. Both fixed and variable rates are available and subject to an allowable spread based upon one of the following base rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prime rate published in a daily national newspaper</li>
<li>The London InterBank one month prime, plus 3%</li>
<li>The SBA peg rate</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though lenders are allowed to add a spread to the base rate, the maximum spread can be no more than 2.5% on loans with maturities shorter than seven years and no more than 2.75% on loans with maturities seven years or longer.</p>
<h4><strong>The CDC 504 Loan Program</strong></h4>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/ofa/resources/4049">CDC 504 loan</a> program is designed to provide financing for major fixed assets like equipment and real estate. The following three categories, determine maximum loan amounts.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Job Creation:</em> The maximum loan amount associated with a job creation or community development goal is $5 million. You business must create one job for every $65,000 borrowed. Small manufacturers must create one job for every $100,000 borrowed.</li>
<li><em>Public Policy:</em> The maximum loan amount associated with a public policy goal is $5 million or $5.5 million for small manufacturing, energy reduction, or alternative fuels. Public policy goals include business district revitalization, minority business development, expansion of veteran-owned business and women-owned business, to name a few.</li>
<li><em>Small Manufacturing:</em> The maximum loan amount for small manufacturers is $4 million. To qualify for a $4 million 504 loan, your business must meet the definition of a small manufacturer and accomplish one of the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Create or retain at least one job per $100,000 guaranteed by the SBA</em></li>
<li><em>Improve the economy of the locality or achieve one or more public policy goals</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The assets being financed are typically used for collateral along with a personal guarantee of the principle owner(s). Loan terms of 10 and 20 years are available, with interest rates pegged to an increment above the current market rate for 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury issues. Fees totaling approximately three percent may be financed with the loan.</p>
<h4><strong>The SBA Microloan Program</strong></h4>
<p>The SBA <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/content/microloan-program-factsheet">Microloan Program</a> is designed for very small loans that are available for newly established or growing small businesses. The SBA makes these funds available through nonprofit community-based lenders. The maximum microloan at the SBA is $50,000 and application and credit decisions are made at the local level.</p>
<p>Microloans can be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working capital</li>
<li>Inventory or supplies</li>
<li>Furniture or fixtures</li>
<li>Machinery or equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Like a 7(a) loan, loan proceeds can’t be used to pay existing debts. They also may not be used to purchase real estate.</p>
<p>Repayment terms vary according to several factors that include the amount of the loan, what the loan proceeds will be used for, the requirements of the intermediary lender, and the needs of the borrower. The maximum allowable repayment term is six years.</p>
<p>The interest rates vary, depending upon the lender and the costs to the lender from the U.S. Treasury. Rates are normally between 8 percent and 13 percent.</p>

<h4><strong>Disaster Loan Program</strong></h4>
<p>The Disaster Loan Program is designed to provide low-interest loans to businesses of all sizes, private non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters to repair or replace real estate, personal property, machinery, or equipment that was damaged or destroyed resulting from a declared disaster.</p>
<p>You can apply online or in-person for SBA disaster assistance. The SBA suggests the online application is the fastest way to receive a decision about your eligibility, but you also have the option of submitting an application by mail.</p>
<p>SBA loan guarantee programs may not be the biggest source of funds for small business owners, but they do fill an important niche within the small business lending landscape for those that qualify. Depending upon loan purpose, qualification criteria, and how quickly a business needs to access funds, the SBA may be a good option for many small business owners.</p>
<p>Borrowers should be prepared, however, to meet many of the same criteria required for a traditional loan approval at the bank including some <em>additional</em> requirements set in place by the SBA. And, although recent efforts by the SBA to streamline the application process have reduced the time it takes for many business owners, qualified potential borrowers should expect a weeks- or sometimes even months-long process to apply, gain approval, and access funds.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>OnDeck loans are secured by a general lien on business assets, but are not dependent upon the value of specific assets—unlike traditional bank loans.</strong></p>
<p>Many small business owners looking for unsecured business loans or lines of credit typically don&#8217;t have the collateral that a bank may require, such as real estate, inventory, or other hard assets. This can make it difficult to qualify for a business loan with a traditional lender like a bank.</p>
<p>Banks generally underwrite loans based upon the value of specific assets and attach liens to those specific assets to secure a small business loan. In this way, the bank can reduce its lending risk. This process can be difficult for business owners whose assets are not valued highly by the bank or are difficult to value or sell.</p>
<p><strong>Why are OnDeck Loans Different?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck loan approvals are based upon healthy business fundamentals like cash flow, not based solely upon the value of any particular business asset. A proprietary way of determining who it lends to (the OnDeck Score®) focuses on the overall health of the business. Whether or not a business has specific assets to use as collateral doesn&#8217;t factor into an analysis of business health.</p>
<p>When a business accepts a loan from OnDeck, a general lien is placed on business assets until the loan has been paid in full. A personal guarantee is also required from the business owner, but there is no lien placed on his or her personal assets. In this way, business owners can qualify for loans from $5,000 to $500,000. In most cases, they&#8217;ll get an answer on their loan application with the same day (sometimes with the hour) without the need to collateralize a particular piece of real estate, inventory, or other had asset, making it possible for many healthy businesses that don&#8217;t have collateral to qualify for a small business loan.</p>
<p>With that in mind, if you have a healthy business, but aren&#8217;t sure about the value of specific collateral, consider applying for an OnDeck loan.</p>
<p><strong>Compare Loan Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bank Loans:</em> Underwritten using specific collateral. A lien on the asset(s) + a personal guarantee</li>
<li><em>Equipment Financing:</em> Equipment as collateral + a personal guarantee</li>
<li>OnDeck Loan: Doesn&#8217;t require specific assets for collateral. A general lien on business assets + a personal guarantee</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> There are a couple of different ways to finance the equipment a small business needs. Equipment financing is basically approached by either leasing or financing an equipment purchase. And, while many people associate large construction equipment or the machines used in manufacturing as "equipment," the reality is just about any asset used to conduct business could be considered "equipment."</p><p>For example, the pizza oven used in a restaurant or the computers used by a software developer could both be either leased, or purchased, as equipment.</p><p>While there's no hard and fast rules for when to lease or when to purchase, it's important to understand the differences so you can make an informed decision regarding which is the best approach to meet your equipment financing needs. Continue reading to learn more about how leasing and financing work; and even some of the pros and cons associated with leasing or financing an equipment purchase.</p>		</div>
		
<p>To understand equipment financing and leasing, it&#8217;s important to understand what is considered &#8220;equipment&#8221;. In terms of equipment financing—it&#8217;s more than just a construction loan; or a loan to buy construction equipment. Any tangible asset, other than property or a building, used in the operation of a business may be considered business equipment. For example, desks for an expanding office, a pizza oven in an Italian restaurant, a dental X-ray machine, as well as a large milling machine or construction implement, may all qualify as business equipment.</p>
<p>Many businesses choose to finance the purchase of expensive equipment to spread the cost over the useful life of the asset, making the purchase more accessible. There are also times when a business will choose to finance the purchase of equipment, to free up capital to invest in other areas of the business. As a result, equipment financing can be a useful tool.</p>
<p><strong>There are two options available for financing new equipment for a business:</strong></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">1</span> Equipment Leasing<br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">2</span> Equipment Financing</strong></h4>
<p>Here are some important things you need to know about each financing type to help you determine which will make the most sense for your small business.</p>
<h3><strong>Equipment Leasing</strong></h3>
<p>Leasing is similar to borrowing, however in a lease, it’s the lender that purchases the equipment and then leases (rents) it back to you for a flat monthly fee—sometimes lower than the payment on a loan would be. Most equipment leases come with a fixed interest rate and fixed term, but interest rates and terms can vary depending upon the leasing company and your credit profile. You can expect to see anywhere from high single digits to double digits, so it makes sense to shop around before you commit. At the end of the lease, you may be able to purchase the equipment at fair market value, or a predetermined amount—sometimes for as little as $1, depending upon the lease.</p>
<p><strong>How Does Leasing Work?</strong></p>
<p>Many equipment dealers offer equipment leasing through an in-house leasing department or work with other leasing companies they recommend. This can streamline the application process and make leasing equipment very convenient.</p>
<p>A lease is not a loan, so it does not appear on your credit report as a loan. Nevertheless, like a loan, standard lease terms can include three, seven, or even 10 years. Additionally, your lease payment might even be deductible as a business expense (this is something you should consult with your tax advisor about).</p>
<p>Although the lease doesn’t appear on you credit profile as a loan, your timely payments will likely be reflected on your business credit profile the same as any other revolving debt—provided the leasing company reports to the business credit bureaus (which it probably does).</p>
<p>Although there is no hard and fast rule for what type of equipment is best suited to a lease vs. a purchase, there are some types of equipment that could make more sense for a lease because of the shorter usable life of the equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-tech computers</li>
<li>Software</li>
<li>Some medical equipment</li>
<li>And equipment that gets a lot of wear and tear</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Equipment Financing</strong></h3>
<p>Equipment <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/guide-small-business-borrowing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loans</a> can come from a variety of sources depending upon your credit worthiness and the nature of the equipment being purchased. These sources could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial banks</li>
<li>Credit unions</li>
<li>Online lenders</li>
<li>Government-backed SBA loans</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending upon the nature of the equipment. In a construction equipment loan, for example, the equipment itself can sometimes be used for <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/collateral-really-need-business-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collateralizing</a> the loan. And, depending upon the type and cost of the equipment being purchased, equipment loans can sometimes be for smaller amounts than a typical bank loan; which could make traditional financing an option for qualified small business borrowers.</p>
<p>Terms for equipment loans vary depending upon the individual lender. Commercial loan repayment terms tend to max out at seven years for most loans with interest rates that will also vary depending upon the lender, your credit profile, and the amount borrower.</p>
<p>To qualify for an equipment loan at the credit union, you will need to be a member to apply.</p>
<p>Online lenders also offer financing that is suited to purchasing equipment; and similar to what is described above for traditional lenders, rates and terms will vary depending on the individual lender you choose. Although interest rates could be higher, a quick response is a hallmark of online lenders—often responding to a loan application with an hour and depositing funds in your business bank account within a day or two. Sometimes as quickly as within 24 hours.</p>
<p>While loan terms will differ, depending upon the lender, most traditional lenders will ask for a down payment, likely 20 percent of the loan upfront. An SBA 504 loan will require a 10 percent down payment. As with most loans, the interest on an equipment loan is tax deductible.</p>
<p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>
<p>As with any business loan, make sure you have the documents needed for the particular lender where you’ll be applying. The requirements for <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/guide-small-business-borrowing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional lenders</a> and <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/small-business-loans-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online lenders</a> are different, so the amount and type of documentation will vary depending upon the lender. For example, a loan at the bank may require a business plan while an online loan likely will not.</p>
<p>If you are seeking a loan at the bank, you will meet with a loan officer at the local branch. If you are working through the equipment dealer, they will likely be able to handle your application on site. If you pursue an online loan, that application will take place via their online website and possibly a phone call.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to purchase or lease business equipment, it makes sense to make sure you completely understand the terms and costs. Always take the time to read the fine print and make sure anything unfamiliar or difficult to understand is explained to you.</p>

			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> It's not uncommon to hear the terms "commercial loans" and "business loans" used interchangeably. Businesses both large and small often borrow to fuel growth or fund other business operations, and some kind of commercial loan or other business financing is how they do it. </p><p>In addition to a traditional small business loan, there are more options available today than ever before for those business owners willing to look outside the bank and consider one of the other options, like an online small business loan. In addition to the fact that the lowest rate loan may not be the lowest cost loan, there are some other reasons to consider an online business loan:</p><ol><li><strong>A streamlined application process</strong></li><li><strong>Faster access to capital</strong></li><li><strong>A willingness to work with younger businesses—many online lenders will work with a business with at least a year under their belts as opposed to several years</strong></li><li><strong>Less reliance on a business owner's personal credit score and a greater focus on the metrics that demonstrate business health</strong></li><li><strong>Online lenders will often work with smaller businesses and smaller loan amounts</strong></li><li><strong>Many online lenders don't require specific collateral but apply a general lien on business assets</strong></li><li><strong>They offer loan products better suited to the short-term financial needs of small business owners.</strong></li></ol><p>Many small businesses in need of a commercial loan are now skipping the bank altogether for the speed and convenience of an online loan.

<p>In much the same way larger businesses rely on access to capital to fuel growth and fund many day-to-day operations, small businesses often turn to commercial loans, or small business financing, to do the same thing. Although the commercial loan a large company might use and the loan for a small business might differ in scale, access to capital is an important consideration for any business.</p>
<p>The last several years have seen a lot of changes in small business financing. While overall access to traditional financing from a bank or credit union has become more difficult for some small business borrowers, it can still be a viable option for many others. And fortunately, there are also options for those who don’t find success at the bank.</p>

<p><strong>A Traditional Small Business Loan</strong></p>
<p>The local bank has traditionally been the first place most business owners look when they need a commercial loan. It makes sense; they have their business checking account, maybe a savings account, and possibly even a business credit card there. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for a business owner with a profitable business to get turned away at the local bank.</p>
<p>The banker may be looking for a fairly narrow borrower profile. Frequently, they are looking for businesses with annual revenues of $1 million or more, several years in business, collateral to secure a loan, a business owner with a personal credit score of 680 or better, and larger loan amounts. A business owner who meets those criteria will likely have success at the local bank—provided a traditional bank loan makes sense for their business.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-170997 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1" alt="Commercial-loans_requirements_OnDeck" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_2.jpeg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_2.jpeg?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The Correlation Between Access and Interest Rate</strong></p>
<p>Depending upon the lender, the loan purpose, and the loan amount, a commercial bank loan will likely include a lower interest rate and come with a longer term than other loan types. This could be a good fit for many loan purposes including the purchase of commercial real estate, funding a large expansion project, purchasing equipment that will be depreciated over many years, along with many other longer-term financing needs.</p>
<p>When looking for a small business loan, it’s important to understand how ease of access impacts the loan cost. In other words, the interest rate will typically increase or decrease as the ease of accessing (or qualifying) gets more difficult or becomes easier.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-170996 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1" alt="Commercial-loans_OnDeck" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_3.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_3.jpeg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_3.jpeg?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" />For example, the interest rate on a bank loan can frequently be lower than many other loan types, but will include more rigid qualifying criteria. This makes it important to weigh the value of access verses a lower interest rate in some circumstances—this is true even for very creditworthy borrowers who would otherwise qualify for a traditional commercial loan at the bank but their loan purpose doesn’t give them the luxury of time required to wait for a traditional bank loan.</p>
<p><strong>A Lower Interest Rate Loan Isn’t Always the Lowest Cost Loan</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a low interest rate might not equate to the lowest interest cost. This can be true when comparing a long-term lower-interest-rate loan with short-term financing. As a general rule, a short-term loan will have a higher periodic payment, but a lower total interest cost of the loan when compared to a longer-term loan—even if that loan includes a lower interest rate, because the business is paying interest over a longer period of time. Depending upon the loan purpose, a short-term loan, even a loan that might include a higher interest rate, could be a good choice. Loan purposes that might fit in this category could include purchasing inventory that will be sold in short order, launching a marketing campaign, or filling a seasonal short-term cash flow gap.</p>
<p>In addition to comparing interest rates, it’s important to consider the loan term and the total interest cost of the loan to determine which is the best fit for any particular loan purpose. For example, most people would never purchase a new car with a 30-year auto loan—even if that loan included a low interest rate. Depending upon the loan purpose, there are times when a long-term low-interest loan might not make sense.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-170995 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_4.jpeg?resize=1024%2C384&#038;ssl=1" alt="Commercial-loans_OnDeck" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_4.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_4.jpeg?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Commercial-loans_4.jpeg?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>Where Do Online Small Business Loans Fit?</strong></p>
<p>Not too long ago, online business loans were a second choice to the bank by borrowers who didn’t meet the bank’s strict qualifying requirements. Today, many small business owners make an online small business loan their first choice. The reasons include:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<ol><li><span style="color: #ffffff">A streamlined application process</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Faster access to capital</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">A willingness to work with younger businesses—For example, OnDeck only requires 12 months in business</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Less reliance on a personal credit score, focusing instead on fundamental business health</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">They are willing to work with smaller businesses and smaller loan amounts</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Most online lenders don’t require specific collateral to secure a loan (though may place a general lien on corporate assets)</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Loan products better suited for many shorter-term small business financing needs than those offered at the bank</span></li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>Depending upon the lender, the creditworthiness of the borrower, the loan purpose, and the loan type, online lenders offer a variety of potential loans to small business owners—short- and long-term loans along with lines of credit to meet a variety of business needs. What’s more, the cost to borrowers is coming down. Interest rates may be as low as 9.99 percent AIR for highly qualified borrowers at OnDeck.</p>
<p>Online lenders, like OnDeck, look at your business differently than more traditional small business lenders that heavily weight the value of your personal credit score when they evaluate your business’ credit worthiness. Personal credit score is still part of the equation, but we also look at other indicators to evaluate the health of the business and the business’ creditworthiness. Time in business, cash flow, and other data <em>can</em> be part of the equation. Looking at a business this way allows us to say “Yes” more often. Approval often only takes a few minutes and funds are often delivered as fast as within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck is a Great Choice for a Small Business Loan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Applying for an OnDeck loan is simple and fast</li>
<li>We’ve already delivered over $4 billion to small businesses</li>
<li>OnDeck is a publicly traded company with a Better Business Bureau rating of A+</li>
<li>We make loans from $5,000 to $500,000</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Inventory loans are a popular way for many small businesses to finance the purchase of quick-turnaround inventory. In fact, according to some studies, purchasing inventory is one of the biggest reasons many small businesses borrow capital.</p><p>When borrowing to purchase inventory, it's important to consider the cost of financing and how it will impact the profitability of the inventory you're purchasing.  For example, purchasing inventory this year with a long-term loan of four or five years could eat up profits as the accumulated interest adds up. With that in mind, here are some things to consider when borrowing to purchase inventory:</p><ol><li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> A good rule of thumb is to match the loan term to the estimated life of the inventory. For example, financing for inventory you expect to turn within three to six months might be better suited to a shorter-term loan of equal duration as opposed to a multi-year term.</li><li><strong>Total Dollar Cost:</strong> In addition to loan term, when considering the appropriate cost, the total dollar cost of the financing (the total interest and fees) as opposed to focusing on the APR or interest rate will help you determine if borrowing to purchase inventory makes sense.</li></ol><p>Because there are costs associated with borrowing, including inventory loans, it's a good idea to make sure you understand what the financing will cost and consider the term best suited to your inventory purchase. As a general rule, a shorter-term loan will have a higher periodic payment than a longer-term loan, but will likely have a lower total dollar cost. Keep reading to learn more.</p>		</div>
		
<p>Many businesses use financing to purchase inventory (salable goods) for their business. This is particularly true when opportunities arise to purchase quick-turnaround inventory at a discount. In a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/ETA_Infographic6.pdf">survey</a> conducted in the spring of 2016 by the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA), a little more than half (51 percent) of those surveyed identified inventory financing as the most common reason for seeking a business loan. What’s more, most of the businesses surveyed anticipated a 5x return for every dollar borrowed. In other words, they were leveraging borrowed capital for an opportunity to increase ROI (Return on Investment).</p>

<p>Under the right circumstances, and with the right loan terms, inventory financing could make sense to purchase inventory—provided the business has the appropriate cash flow to make the periodic loan payments.</p>
<p><strong>Loan Term and Total Dollar Cost Make a Difference When There’s a Specific ROI Goal</strong></p>
<p>When purchasing inventory or with any loan purpose tied to a specific ROI target, minimizing the cost of financing to increase the potential ROI is an important consideration. In fact, the majority of the small businesses surveyed by the ETA look to minimize the total dollar cost of a loan when inventory financing, or facing any short-term ROI opportunity. In fact, 57 percent of those surveyed would choose a shorter-term loan with a higher APR over a longer-term loan with a lower APR to minimize the total fees and expenses of inventory financing or any other loan.</p>
<p>APR, or the Annualized Percentage Rate, does not provide the total dollar cost of a loan and is only one metric to compare a small business loan. When borrowing to purchase inventory, the total cost of capital (including any interest or other fees that are a condition of receiving capital) should be considered.</p>
<p>Loan term can make a difference when making a comparison of potential inventory loans. As a general rule, the longer the term the smaller the periodic payment, but the higher the total dollar cost. Short-term loans will likely have a larger periodic payment but the total dollar cost will usually be less. What’s more, a loan with a term of less than a year will (in part, because of the way APR is calculated) likely have a higher APR than a similar interest loan with a longer term. In much the same way the average person wouldn’t buy an automobile with a 30-year auto loan. The total cost of the loan would make the vehicle prohibitively expensive to purchase over time.</p>
<p><strong>A Business Line of Credit for Purchasing Inventory</strong></p>
<p>Another way many business owners finance inventory purchases is with a business line of credit. Unlike a term loan, a line of credit allows the business owner to access part, or all, of the credit line, repay it, and access it again as needed. What’s more, interest is only charged on the credit the business owner uses.</p>
<p>The flexibility of a line of credit allows the business to access funds when needed without going through additional credit approvals during the term of the credit line. When you open a line of credit, you’ll receive access to a stated amount of funds to use as needed.</p>
<p>Rates and credit limits are set by lenders and based upon a credit evaluation, collateral (in some cases), and any servicing requirements. Many lenders charge an annual fee for the credit line in addition to any interest charges. If you are going to regularly access the line with multiple transactions during the term of the credit line, additional fees could also apply.</p>

<p><strong>Does Borrowing Make Sense to Purchase Inventory?</strong></p>
<p>There are certainly costs associated with borrowing that need to be considered, but if the total dollar cost of the loan enables the business to generate additional profits, it could be a good decision—provided the numbers make sense for your business situation.</p>

<h3>Industry Overview</h3>
<p>Finding capital to finance growth is one of the biggest challenges facing a small business owner today. Technology is changing the way small business owners acquire funding, for the better.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-173060 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Compare-chart2.jpg?resize=700%2C251&#038;ssl=1" alt="Online lenders vs banks" width="700" height="251" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Compare-chart2.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Compare-chart2.jpg?resize=300%2C108&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Traditional Financing Options</h3>
<p>Traditional Lenders tend to have a long application process, require significant paperwork, do personal credit based evaluation, only lend large amounts, and require specific high-value collateral.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional financing types include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Term Loans</li>
<li>Bank Lines of Credit</li>
<li>SBA Loans</li>
<li>Merchant Cash Advances</li>
<li>Factoring</li>
<li>Equipment Financing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Online Financing Options</h3>
<p>Online Lenders tend to have a quick application process, request limited paperwork, evaluate your creditworthiness based on the health of your business, lend smaller amounts, and do not require specific high-value collateral.</p>
<p><strong>Online financing types include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online Term Loans</li>
<li>Online Lines of Credit</li>
<li>Crowdfunding</li>
<li>Loan Matching Sites</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minimum Requirements by Financing Type</h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-173061 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Loan-Charts.jpg?resize=900%2C510&#038;ssl=1" alt="Business Loans Comparison Chart - OnDeck Small Business Loans" width="900" height="510" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Loan-Charts.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Loan-Charts.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Loan-Charts.jpg?resize=768%2C435&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Understanding Rates, Costs, and Fees</h3>
<p>You should always ask as many questions as you need to understand exactly how much you’re paying back. Sometimes rates, like AIR and APR don’t tell you the whole picture.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-173062 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q-and-A-what-is-APR.jpg?resize=900%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="Q-and-A-what-is-APR" width="900" height="281" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q-and-A-what-is-APR.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q-and-A-what-is-APR.jpg?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q-and-A-what-is-APR.jpg?resize=768%2C240&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
