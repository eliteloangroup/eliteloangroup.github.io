<p>Having spent 20+ years in a very seasonal small business, I came to appreciate what it takes to manage finances during the busy seasons, bridge the slow seasons, and budget for the year. Fortunately, we had two or three particularly busy seasons during the year, so our annual revenues weren’t dependent upon the holiday season or the summer tourist season to keep us afloat.</p>
<p>It’s always very tempting to spend what you have when there is plenty of revenue coming in, but sticking to a budget and thinking of the big picture (you likely mapped out at the beginning of the year) is a better plan of attack.</p>
<p>If you’re business relies on a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/need-know-business-line-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business line of credit</a> or other financing—like a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/short-term-loans-a-quick-recap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-term business loan</a>—to help bridge from one season to the next, there are a few things you should consider when looking for financing; the first being, don’t wait until your busy season is over and you’re cash poor.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t wait until you are out of cash to borrow:</strong> Most lenders want to know that you have the revenue to support a loan when you <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/online-applications-small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your application</a>. They’ll likely want to look at several month’s worth of your business bank statements to determine if you have the cash flow to support the periodic payments. If you wait to apply until after the revenue stream has significantly dropped, and are in the middle of your bridge season, you will have some explaining to do to account for the lack of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t borrow today if you won’t have the cash flow to service the debt tomorrow:</strong> I believe borrowing to bridge busy seasons can be tricky and takes some extra thought. It’s important to make sure you will still have the revenue needed to make your periodic loan payments. If not, you’ll be damaging your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/have-you-checked-your-business-credit-profile-lately" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business credit profile</a> with every missed or late payment—making it more difficult to borrow the next time you need an infusion of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Borrow what you need—and no more:</strong> There are costs associated with borrowing, so borrowing more than what you’ll really need to get through your slow season can do more harm than good. And, expect to tighten the belt a little. Yes, you may need to cut back on some of the things you’d normally be doing during the busy season, but if you budget well, you’ll be able to bridge busy seasons with a minimal amount of pain. We used to set aside some cash when business was hopping in anticipation of projects we could do during the lull time to keep everyone busy.</li>
<li><strong>Plan ahead and don’t be reactionary:</strong> I’m a big proponent of looking at the year to <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/strategic-borrowing-benefits-to-increase-your-loan-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategically borrow</a> and planning in advance for the bridge seasons. This could mean putting aside some cash when cash flow is good to cover times when it’s not. I could also mean recognizing the need for financing and working to improve your business credit profile now, so you’ll have more options available to you when you need to borrow a little extra operating capital.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t ignore your personal credit score:</strong> For most small business owners, your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/lender-want-know-personal-credit-score" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal credit score</a> will be a factor when a lender is evaluating your business’ creditworthiness. The lower your score, the fewer options you will have when it’s time to borrow. Fortunately, we tend to impact the metrics we pay attention to. So, if you have a less-than-perfect personal credit score you can improve it by monitoring your score, correcting the areas that are pulling you down, and paying your personal obligations in a timely manner. Even if you have a poor score, with effort, you can make improvements. It won’t happen overnight, but it will happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prudently managing cash, financing, and operational needs during your busy season will help you keep your business profitable all year long. For many business, financing is a valuable tool that helps the do it. Just remember, thinking ahead and planning for the ups and downs of your business will help you avoid making reactionary decisions that can sometimes do more harm than good.</p>

			<p><strong>Article Summary: </strong>There are more small business loan options available today than ever before. The technology associated with online applications for small business loans also makes it easier to research and apply for a loan.</p><p>That being said, it involves a lot more than simply publishing an application online. The most successful online lenders are looking at the small business loan process from a different paradigm and evaluating the health of a business differently than a traditional lender like a bank or credit union.

<p>Technology is changing everything.

Similarly, many lenders are turning to online applications for small business loans.</p>

<p>As more and more people do business on their smartphones, tablets, and computers, it’s no wonder that online applications for small business loans are the preferred choice of many business owners. In fact, one of the top three reasons cited for choosing an online business loan in a survey conducted earlier this year by the <a href="http://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/ETA_Infographic6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electronic Transactions Association</a>, was the easy application process.</p>
<p>Along with speed to funding (63 percent) and affordable total loan cost (51 percent), 57 percent of those surveyed identified that easy online applications are one of the primary reasons they opted for an online business loan. When you consider the traditional weeks-long process and reams of documents associated with a traditional loan application, a simple, easy-to-understand, online loan application makes a lot of sense for time-crunched small business owners.</p>

<h3>Nevertheless, Simply Putting an Application Online Isn’t Enough</h3>
<p>A small business owner shouldn’t have to be a financial expert to complete a loan application; and small business lenders (like <a href="https://online.ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnDeck</a>) are embracing a new paradigm to provide business owners with efficient access to the capital they need to build growing businesses that strengthen communities and create jobs.</p>
<p>By looking at small business lending and the qualification process differently, these lenders are turning traditional credit models that rely heavily on personal credit score and specific collateral on their heads. Since we opened our doors in 2007, we’ve loaned over $10 Billion to more than 80,000 small business owners—which has taught us a thing or two about small business borrowers and how to evaluate a small business’ creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Additionally, a safe and secure online applications process is important to business owners whether they’re borrowing $5,000 or $500,000. At OnDeck, your loan application is protected by encryption and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure your sensitive information is securely sent to OnDeck.</p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions When Applying for a Business Loan</h3>
<p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Do I need collateral to get a small business loan?<br />
</strong>Some lenders, including many traditional lenders like the bank, do require specific collateral for a small business loan, meaning many potentially good borrowers could struggle to access the capital they need because their business doesn’t have the needed collateral to secure a loan. We do not require a specific type of collateral, but do require a general lien on business assets along with a personal guarantee to secure an OnDeck loan.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a business loan without being a corporation? Can a sole proprietor get a business loan?<br />
</strong>You do not need to be incorporated to get a small business loan provided you are a registered business with a business checking account and have a business tax I.D. number. You must also use your business loan strictly for business purposes. However, there may be potential benefits to incorporation and you should consult with an attorney or other trusted legal advisor to determine if changing the nature of your business entity makes sense for your business objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a business loan after a bankruptcy?<br />
</strong>Qualifying for a business loan following a bankruptcy will be more difficult during the 10 years after the bankruptcy appears on your credit report, but there are lenders that will work with your business if the bankruptcy has been discharged for at least two years.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a business loan with a less-than-perfect personal credit score?<br />
</strong>Regardless of the lender, your personal credit score will frequently be a part of your business’ creditworthiness evaluation. Nevertheless, traditional lenders are likely to weight the value of your personal score more heavily than many online lenders do, so if you have an otherwise healthy business and can demonstrate that your business has the cash flow to make timely loan payments, it is possible to qualify for a loan with a less-than-perfect personal credit score.</p>
<p>Because lenders look at your past credit behavior as a way to evaluate what you will do in the future, you should be prepared to explain any extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to your poor personal credit profile. As a general rule, a personal credit score below 680 will make qualifying for a loan at the bank problematic and a score below 650 will likely rule out an SBA loan, so if your personal score is below the 650 threshold, you’ll likely need to look at alternative financing options, but it is possible to gain a loan approval. Nevertheless, taking action to improve your personal credit score, while it might not guarantee a loan approval, will give your business financing options you might not otherwise have.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a business plan to get a business loan?<br />
</strong>Traditional lenders like banks, credit unions, and the SBA often require a business plan, however many online lenders look at other business metrics and don’t require a formal business plan.</p>
<p><strong>What documents do I typically need for a business loan?<br />
</strong>Depending upon the lender there will likely be different document requirements, but having these documents (or at least the information) at your fingertips will make it much easier to apply for a loan at the local bank or an online small business lender regardless of whether or not the documents are required:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Your business financial statements including a Profit and Loss (P&amp;L), an Income Statement, and an outline of your expenses</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Your personal financial information including the last three years of personal income tax returns</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Your business license</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">A copy of your business lease</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">You business bank statements for the last three months</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">See also, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/sba-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“What do I need for an SBA loan?”</a></p>
<p><strong>How do I get a startup loan?<br />
</strong>Aside from the SBA—which has a guarantee program for well-qualified startups—there aren’t a lot of small business loan options for very early stage startups. Most traditional lenders prefer to see a few years in business, although many online lenders (like OnDeck) will work with a business that has at least a year in business. Some non-profit micro-lenders do offer business loans to qualifying startups.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need collateral to get an equipment loan or lease?<br />
</strong>The equipment you are leasing or buying is usually considered the collateral in an equipment lease or equipment loan.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a personal guarantee to get a business loan?<br />
</strong>Small business owners are frequently required to give a personal guarantee when applying for a small business loan.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for a small business loan?<br />
</strong>If you are applying for a loan at the local bank or credit union, you traditionally will meet with a loan officer in the branch office and be given the appropriate forms to complete the application.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for an SBA Loan?<br />
</strong>The SBA is not a lender, but offers a loan guarantee program with banks, credit unions, and other lenders. You can apply at participating banks. The SBA&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/lendermatch">Lender Match</a> tool will help match you to a participating lender in your area.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for an online business loan?<br />
</strong>If you apply for an online business loan, you will generally complete a simple online application as described above.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if I can trust an online lender?<br />
</strong>You can start by checking their <a href="http://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/business-reviews/financial-services/on-deck-capital-inc-in-new-york-ny-101780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Business Bureau</a> ranking and look for mentions of them in news organizations like CNBC, Bloomberg, PBS, and others. You can also look for them on third-party review sites like <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrustPilot</a>.</p>

<p>Many businesses finance growth and meet short-term capital needs with a small business loan. There are times when fast access to additional capital, or access to a fast business loan, is critical to taking advantage of an opportunity to create additional ROI or meet a short-term business challenge. Unfortunately, because popular media promotes the idea that money is the solution to every business challenge and the more the better—it’s important to remember that borrowing more than is required can be expensive for small businesses; and could even put their viability at risk.</p>

<p>Although a traditional small business loan from the bank is a good option for some borrowers and some circumstances, there are many situations when the typical weeks-long processes associated with their application criteria makes it simply too slow or burdensome given the business need. When unexpected expenses, or opportunities require a fast business loan, the local bank might not be the best choice.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in many instances a quick answer to your loan application is often available online. Lenders like <a target="_blank" href="https://online.ondeck.com">OnDeck</a>, for example, are often able to have an answer to your loan request in under an hour—sometimes as quickly as within a few minutes, and once approved, you can often have the loan proceeds in your bank account the next day, sometimes within 24 hours.</p>

<h2><strong>Circumstances that Could Require a Quick Small Business Loan</strong></h2>
<p>Not all businesses or surprises are the same, but here are some pretty common business expenses that are sometimes difficult to anticipate:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ol><li><strong>Equipment failure:</strong> If your business relies on specialized equipment to do business, regardless of whether it’s a pizza oven critical to your restaurant or a large milling machine that plays an integral role within your manufacturing process, every hour that equipment is down is costing your business money. Acting fast to get up and running again is a part of staying viable.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Building maintenance problems:</strong> If you do business out of an older building, it’s not uncommon to occasionally face plumbing, electrical, or other building maintenance problems. The costs of digging up a sewer line to the street or putting a new roof on your building can easily add up beyond what might be available in your cash flow—particularly if the expenses are unexpected and need to be responded to quickly.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Growing pains:</strong> Most business owners welcome the opportunity to grow, but sometimes growth comes with unexpected expenses. There are sometimes overlooked expenses to hiring new employees like additional supplies, training, or maybe the need to purchase a new desk and office equipment. Depending upon your business, ramping up a new employee can become expensive. While most business owners want to see their businesses grow, it’s difficult to anticipate every expense associated with growth.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Unexpected opportunities to increase profits:</strong> Not all surprises are bad news. For example, suppliers sometimes offer unexpected discounts to their customers who can act quickly to take advantage of a special offer. It might be an opportunity to purchase quick-turnaround inventory at a steep discount or maybe a special offer on a new piece of timesaving equipment that will make serving your customers more efficient. To take advantage of opportunities like these, you’ll need to act fast and won’t be able to wait for several weeks to get an answer from the local bank.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>An opportunity to expand:</strong> Maybe that extra space next door has become available or the bigger storefront down the street has gone up for sale. The opportunity to expand might make it possible to secure more customers and generate more income, but the added expense might be something you hadn’t anticipated. Quick access to capital might be required to pull it all together.</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>These are just a few of the unexpected business expenses that might require a fast business loan. Knowing where to look for a quick business loan when you need an answer right away can sometimes make the difference between solving a problem, taking advantage of an opportunity, or not.</p>
<h3><strong>Speed to Funding</strong></h3>
<p>In a survey conducted in the spring of 2016 by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/ETA_Infographic6.pdf">Electronic Transaction Association</a> (ETA), 63 percent of the small businesses surveyed identified speed to funding as the reason they chose an online business loan. 57 percent cited the easy application process and 51 percent the affordable total loan cost. Needless to say, a quick answer and quick access to funds is an important consideration to many small business owners.</p>
<p>96 percent of those surveyed said the reason they were borrowing was to secure capital to enable or drive business growth. Additionally, these small businesses generally anticipate a 5x return for every dollar they borrow. In other words, they expect to earn $5 for every $1 they finance to purchase things like inventory (51 percent) or equipment (54 percent).</p>
<h3><strong>Fast Business Loans From OnDeck</strong></h3>
<p>While a traditional bank loan often requires specific collateral before they will lend to a small business and may rely heavily on the personal credit of the business owner, OnDeck offers fast small business loans from $5,000 to $500,000 with a general lien on business assets during the loan term and a personal guarantee. In this way, small business owners are able to access the capital they need quickly without securing the loan with specific collateral, and are able to repay the loan quickly to manage expenses.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated: Feb. 21, 2019</em></p>
<p>We want to make getting business financing from OnDeck as easy as possible. And we often get asked the same questions by small business owners looking to take financing for their business. So, we want to share the top 10 questions we get asked and answer them for you.</p>
<p><strong>1. What products do you offer?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck offers true small business <strong>Term Loans</strong> and <strong>Lines of Credit</strong>.</p>
<p>We have one simple application for both term loans and lines of credit, so we can present you with all of the financing options available to you and your business.</p>
<p><strong>2. What are your loan amounts and terms?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck offers Term Loans from $5,000 &#8211; $500,000 over 3-36 months.<sup> 1</sup></p>
<p>Our Lines of Credit go up to $100,000 with payback on draws up to 12 months. (The lines of credit are revolving, so as you pay it back your available funds increase.)</p>
<p><strong>3. How does the application process work?</strong></p>
<p>Our application takes minutes to complete! You can apply <a target="_blank" href="http://online.ondeck.com"><u>online</u></a> or over the phone by calling (888) 269-4246.</p>
<p>We’ll only need your basic business and owner information to apply and 3 months of your most recent bank statements.</p>
<p><strong>4.Will my credit be impacted by applying?</strong></p>
<p>We are mindful of your hesitation to have a credit inquiry on your record. In the US, we always do a “soft pull” (which doesn’t impact your personal credit score), unless your credit file is restricted, in which case we would contact you to lift the restriction and do a hard pull.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are your minimum requirements?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck Minimum Requirements Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 year in business. Our median customer has been in business for 7 years.</li>
<li>$100,000 in gross annual revenue. Typical gross annual revenues exceed $450,000.</li>
<li>Business owner’s minimum personal credit score of 600. The majority of owners have scores of 650 or higher.</li>
<li>At least 5 deposits to your business checking each month</li>
</ul>
<p>OnDeck serves over 700 industries, so it’s likely that we’re able to work with you.<br />
Just in case, here is <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/restricted-industries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list of the few industries</a> we can’t serve.</p>
<p><strong>6. What information do I need to apply?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck requires little to no paperwork to apply. Before you start filling out the application make sure to have this information on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your  Business Tax ID number (EIN)</li>
<li>Your Social Security number</li>
<li>Estimated annual gross revenue</li>
<li>Average bank balance</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You will need to submit your last 3 months of business bank statements.</em><sup>2</sup><strong> (</strong>Need help downloading your bank statements from your bank’s website? <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/how-to-download-your-bank-statements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are step-by-step instructions for some major banks</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>7. What are your rates?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The cost of your loan depends are many variables. Your actual rate is primarily determined by our OnDeck Score technology. We analyze numerous data points and base your rates on the health of your business, not just your personal credit score.</p>
<p><em>OnDeck offers a range of rates based on your business. OnDeck offers:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Term loans as low as 9.99% annual interest rate (AIR)<sup>1,3</sup></li>
<li>Lines of Credit as low as 13.99% annual percentage rate (APR)<sup>1,3</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. How does payback work?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck uses frequent payments to payback your loan without the burden of a large monthly payment that banks and many other lenders put on you. We know this is a little different, but it works for our customers. The daily or weekly payment is based on the amount and term length of your financing and is intended to be a manageable number based on the data you provided to OnDeck.</p>
<p><strong>9. How can this loan help my business credit?</strong></p>
<p>If you take a loan from OnDeck, an institution that reports to the business credit bureaus, and if you make timely payments, then these payments should help build your business credit profile, which in turn may lead to better offers if you apply for a loan again in the future.</p>
<p>OnDeck reports to three of the major business credit bureaus—Experian, Equifax, and Paynet—so any future lender can see your good business credit profile if you make timely payments and pay down the loan in full. Want to know more? <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/lenders-that-report-to-credit-bureaus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read this quick article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>10. How long does it take to get funded?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck can deliver decisions in minutes, and funding in as fast as 1 business day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>All loans subject to lender approval. Depending on the state where your business is located and other attributes of the loan, your business loan may be issued by Celtic Bank, a Utah-Chartered Industrial Bank, Member FDIC. Your loan agreement will identify the loan issuer prior to your signing.</p>
<p>¹Eligibility for the lowest rates, largest amounts, and longest term lengths are very limited, available only to businesses with the strongest creditworthiness and cash flows, and typically businesses that have shown an excellent payment history on prior loan products with OnDeck. The weighted average rate for term loans is 24.6% simple interest and 42.5% AIR; weighted average for lines of credit is 32.1% APR. Weighted averages are based on loans originated in quarter ending June 30, 2017.</p>
<p><sup> 2</sup> Some further documentation may be needed, for example to verify identities.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> <strong>Rate Definitions:</strong><br />
Simple Interest: Total interest you will pay, and given as a percentage of the amount borrowed, excluding fee<br />
Annual Interest Rate: The interest rate in annualized terms, excluding fees<br />
Annual Percentage Rate: The interest rate in annualized terms, including fees</p>
