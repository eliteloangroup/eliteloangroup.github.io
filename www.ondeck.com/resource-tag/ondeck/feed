								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Helping small businesses is our passion and we are passionate about small businesses. If you ask anyone who works at OnDeck about their favorite small business, they can immediately tell you the business name, location, and why it means so much to them. I grew up in rural South Carolina where both of my grandparents owned small businesses. My Pop (grandpa) owned Anderson Lumber Company and my Nonnie (grandma) owned the Beauty Shop. Like many children and grandchildren of business owners, I grew spending a lot of time in both of those businesses and my first jobs were working there with my family. A lot of my colleagues have similar experiences and several even have their own small businesses. We are deeply invested in the success of the businesses we work and your Loan Advisor will be your personal advocate throughout your relationship with us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of this article is to introduce the benefits of our Loan Advisory program to all current and future business owners and let you know what to expect from your experience with a Loan Advisor on your financing journey.</span></p>
<h3><b>One Team</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Small businesses operate throughout all times zones across the country. To make sure you get the best service possible during hours that work for your business at the right time we have Loan Advisors in NYC and Denver offices. When you need us, someone will be available to speak with you, 6 days a week. We also want to make sure when you need us you are speaking to someone with experience, which is why our Loan Advisors have an average tenure of five years in their role and we make sure to continually train them in all areas from new internal policies to external factors affecting business owners globally. Your loan advisors must demonstrate mastery in competencies like relationship building, financial literacy, product/technical knowledge, and compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our loan advisor teams work closely with our other departments such as underwriting and customer service teams to ensure you are provided with the relevant information you need. We work as one team to make sure we get you the best offer and give you the best experience. We leverage our internal relationships to give you a seamless experience. While you may only ever speak to one person, that person on average works with up to a dozen other people to shepherd you through our process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We work as one team focused on giving you the best possible experience. As we celebrate our company milestones, we relish the opportunity to help you meet yours.</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #83eece;">
			<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“The most important thing to know about me is that I try to treat each of my clients like they are the only client I am ever dealing with – I dedicate my time, efforts, and support to them fully, and never want them to think or know that I’m also communicating with up to 50+other small business owners that day.”  – Anastasia Petrovek, OnDeck Loan Advisor</span></i></p>		</div>
		
<h3><b>White Glove Service</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our main goal is to give our customers impeccable service. How do we do this? We focus on building great relationships with each business owner we work with. We want to learn about your goals in order to help you achieve them. Every time you speak with your loan advisor s/he is focused on understanding the impact of working capital on your business. Our Loan Advisors are your advocates and guides – they set expectations around the process including what kinds of documents you may need to provide, the timeline for getting funded, and how to take advantage of our renewal program. </span><b> </b></p>

			<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><em>Updated Oct 2018<br /></em>When your business is eligible to apply for a renewal with OnDeck, we’re here to help you prepare. We’ve put together 5 things you can do to save time and make for a better renewal experience.</span></p><ol><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Be in Good Standing with your Secretary of State</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Review your OnDeck payment history</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Evaluate changes in your cash flow</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Monitor your business credit</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Keep tax filings handy<br /><br /></span></li></ol><p><span style="color: #ffffff">You can call your dedicated account manager or OnDeck’s Small Business Credit Advisor team (<a style="color: #ffffff" href="mailto:creditadvisor@ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email us</a>) for any help you need in getting ready.</span></p>		</div>
		
<h3><strong>1. Be in Good Standing with your Secretary of State</strong></h3>
<p>Businesses must file an annual report with the Secretary of State’s Office. This proves that your business met compliance requirements and may conduct business in the state. When your filing is in order and you’ve paid all required fees, your business is “active” and in Good Standing. To check your entity status,  visit your Secretary of State’s website to access its online report filing system. This is especially important if you’ve undergone changes to the corporation or LLC/LLP, business address, or DBA name.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Review your OnDeck payment history</strong></h3>
<p>Making on-time payments are a positive reflection of your credit profile. Too many missed payments can impact your renewal eligibility, so it’s important that you are up to date when you apply. Given that business owners may use several bank accounts at a time, it’s a good idea to track or set up alerts for your bank account on file with OnDeck. You may want to keep in contact with <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/support">OnDeck’s Payment Support team</a>, if needed.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Evaluate changes in your cash flow</strong></h3>
<p>Lenders want to understand your business’s cash flow and sales patterns – and so should you. Your current cash flow may differ from when you last applied, so carefully consider the timing of your next application. Keep in mind that OnDeck looks for at least 5 deposits to your bank account per month; for 3 months of bank statements, this means at least 15 deposits.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Monitor your business credit</strong></h3>
<p>OnDeck reports your on-time payments to major credit bureaus to help you build up a business credit profile. Good business credit shows lenders you are a credit-worthy customer. This distinction may increase your financing options in the future. You can check out your business credit profile with a service like our partner, <a href="https://app.nav.com/registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nav</a>.  OnDeck’s <a href="mailto:creditadvisor@ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Credit Advisors</a> can also provide you with one-on-one advice regarding business credit, Secretary of State, and general business questions.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Keep tax filings handy </strong></h3>
<p>Tax returns and extensions allows OnDeck to verify information like ownership percentage, financials, and Secretary of State. To speed up the application process, it’s helpful to keep a copy of your most recent return accessible.</p>
