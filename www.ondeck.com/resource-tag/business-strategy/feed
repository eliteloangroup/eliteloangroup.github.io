								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a small business owner, you may be uncertain about how to articulate your <strong>value proposition</strong>. You may even be unclear on the concept of just what a value proposition is. Simply put, a value proposition is a marketing statement that describes why a prospective customer or client should choose your company over a competitor.</p>
<p>A good value proposition represents an excellent foundation for an overall sales or marketing plan. However, building on that, you&#8217;ll also require a solid understanding of the basics of sales, your company’s products and customer base, and your capability to deliver. This all leads to the important first step of developing an effective elevator pitch. Then, it&#8217;s all about following through on that pitch, closing the deal and managing your customer or client base on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>This article explores key steps in that process of showing a prospective customer why they should buy from you.</p>
<h2><strong>The Basics of Sales</strong></h2>
<p>Sales, advertising, and marketing perform different functions, but all three have the same essential goal – increasing your company’s customer or client base. There are two basic concepts to any sales pitch: convincing customers or clients their needs (or desires) can be met by your company, and demonstrating that your company is better equipped to meet those needs or desires better than the competition.</p>
<p>Of course, the specifics vary according to your company, your target client or customer base, market conditions and your competition. Your company’s specific sales pitch should naturally adjust as well, with targeted messages to different segments of your present customer or client base, and another message for prospective customers or clients.</p>
<p>Marketing costs, and the resources to cover those costs also vary depending on whether your company is well established in the market or entering a crowded set of competitors. Social media has leveled the playing field somewhat. A single viral post can put a company on the map for little or no money. Nonetheless, very rarely can social media stand alone as a marketing strategy. Even so, a small company often has limited resources to devote to a marketing or advertising campaign. A <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/business-loans">business loan</a> can provide an important boost to marketing efforts.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Would Someone Choose to Buy from You in General?</strong></h2>
<p>The key to a successful sales pitch is conveying how your company and its products and services are both <strong>distinct from and superior to</strong> those of your competitors. For instance, in a highly competitive market you may find it necessary to compete on price, or at least demonstrate exceptional value for money if you can’t (or choose not to) compete strictly on price. In a high-end market, you may emphasize your company’s upscale features, either in luxury-grade materials, exceptional workmanship, outstanding customer service or some combination of the three. A 100 percent satisfaction guarantee also helps to transform prospects into customers.</p>
<p>However, many of today’s consumers, especially those among younger demographics, also demand more than just great products or services. Demonstrating corporate responsibility through transparency in company policies and community outreach enhances your company’s credibility with thoughtful consumers and clients.</p>
<h2><strong>Sales Pitch 101: What&#8217;s Your Business&#8217; Official Sales Pitch?</strong></h2>
<p>Unless you are a natural salesperson, you may hesitate to engage in a full-scale sales pitch. However, cultivating new customers and clients — and maintaining them — is essential to remaining in business.</p>
<p>Once you’ve developed a prospect list, you should create a qualifying script to determine whether a given individual has the authority and budget to purchase your products or contract for your services.</p>
<p>Once a particular target has been qualified as a prospect, the actual sales pitch should be conducted less as a hard sell and more like an open-ended conversation. Having a set of talking points is helpful, but you don’t want to sound like you’re reading from a prepared script. Instead, pay attention to clues such as “we’ve been thinking about this type of product” or “that would really address some challenges we’re having.” These represent ripe prospects.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Create an Elevator Pitch?</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, the most well-thought-out sales pitch is useless if you never have a chance to use it. That’s where an elevator pitch can help. An elevator pitch can benefit small business owners and entrepreneurs, not just job seekers. An elevator pitch is a succinct description of your company’s products or services, target customers or clients, factors that distinguish your company from the competition and a call to action.</p>
<p>The hook is the key to an effective elevator pitch. The hook is a catchy one or two sentence statement that summarizes your elevator pitch while commanding the attention of your audience and drawing them into the substance of your elevator pitch. While telling an engaging story is important, there’s no need to strain to be humorous or entertaining. Your goal is for your audience to take you seriously and this requires a careful balance.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Manage Your Prospects and Customers</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve done the hard work of developing prospects and customers, proper management and maintenance is essential. <strong>Relationship building</strong> is the potential “secret sauce” that builds a loyal customer base. Maintain regular contact through promotions and special offers.</p>
<p>However, contacts should not be limited to sales or marketing efforts. If possible, one great strategy for customer relationship maintenance is to establish a blog and send out regular updates. But if maintaining a blog is not feasible, regular email messages containing links to industry-relevant articles is a good substitute. The time required represents one more demand on your probably-limited resources, but the effort will pay dividends in increased sales and revenues.</p>
<h2>Making the Sale</h2>
<p>Your company’s value proposition represents a valuable foundation for your marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. Your elevator speech, sales pitch and any marketing efforts should focus on why your company’s products or services would be better at filling your customers’ or clients’ needs than your competitors. While social media can help raise your company’s profile, especially with younger demographics, counting on “going viral” isn’t a viable marketing strategy. While conventional marketing and advertising can be prohibitively expensive for a small business or solo entrepreneur, a business loan can help level the marketing playing field.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While you don&#8217;t need a business plan to run a business. Following a good business plan can mean the difference between achieving success and going out of business. Completing a written business plan actually <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/business-plan-success-twice-as-likely.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubles the chances of your business succeeding</a>. The survey results showed that business owners who complete written business plans are twice as likely to grow their business, secure investment capital or secure a business loan. Having a plan makes your business more attractive to investors and lenders because it shows that you’ve thought through your marketing, operational and financing strategy and you’ve actually crunched the numbers to show you’re a good credit risk. Here’s a guide to the components that go into <a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/district/mo/st-louis/resources/how-write-business-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a winning business plan</a> so you can make your business a success.</p>
<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The first part of a business plan is an executive summary, which provides a brief snapshot of your entire business plan. Your executive summary should cover the highlights of the other sections of your business plan, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your business description</li>
<li>Your design and development plan</li>
<li>Your operational and management plan</li>
<li>Your competitive analysis</li>
<li>Your marketing and sales strategy</li>
<li>Your financial projections</li>
<li>Your funding needs</li>
</ul>
<p>An executive summary should briefly cover each of these topics, devoting one or a few sentences to each topic over the course of a page or two. Subsequent sections of your business plan will expand on each of these topics in more detail. While an executive summary is the first part of your business plan, you may find it easier to write it after you have written your other sections, or you can write an initial outline of your executive summary and then flesh it out after you complete your business plan’s individual sections.</p>
<h3>Business Description</h3>
<p>Your business description should sum up who you are, what you do, how you do it, who you do it for, and why customers will pay you to do it. It should include answers to questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company name?</li>
<li>What is your business mission?</li>
<li>What problem does your company solve?</li>
<li>How does your product or service solve this problem?</li>
<li>Who needs a solution to your problem?</li>
<li>What makes your company’s solution stand out from that offered by competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will help you clarify your company’s identity and position you in the eyes of potential investors and lenders reading your business plan. It will also provide some background for the rest of your business plan.</p>
<h3>Design and Development Plan</h3>
<p>Your design and development section should describe your product or service. It should answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you sell?</li>
<li>What are the key features of your product or service?</li>
<li>What is your product lifecycle?</li>
<li>What are the key benefits?</li>
<li>What complementary products and services do you sell as upsells or cross-sells?</li>
<li>Do your products and services require any research and development?</li>
<li>Do you need any intellectual property protection such as patents or copyrights?</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will help you clarify the key sales appeal of your product and service line, as well as identify any development that needs to be done to bring your product or service to market.</p>
<h3>Operations and Management Plan</h3>
<p>The operations and management section of your plan lays out how your company is organized. It should address:</p>
<ul>
<li>What legal structure does your company use?</li>
<li>Who are your company’s key personnel, and what expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Will you need to hire any additional personnel with specialized skills, such as sales, design or software development?</li>
<li>What is the general workflow of your daily flow of operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will clarify how you plan to set up and run your company. It will also identify any hiring or outsourcing needs you have, which will be important for estimating your expenses when you do your financial projections.</p>
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>Your competitive analysis section sums up your market research. It should identify who is in your target market and how large your market is. It should also identify your main competitors and how you plan to compete with them to attract your target buyers. This section should answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people buy products and services such as yours?</li>
<li>How much do they spend?</li>
<li>Why do they buy?</li>
<li>Who are your main competitors?</li>
<li>What does the market want that your competitors aren’t delivering?</li>
<li>What will you offer that is different than your competitors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your competitive analysis will provide a basis for developing your marketing strategy. It will also help you estimate your potential revenue, which will be important for writing the financial section of your business plan.</p>
<h3>Marketing and Sales Strategy</h3>
<p>The marketing strategy section of your plan builds on your market research by identifying the specific strategies and tactics you will use to reach your target market and persuade them to buy from you. It should cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing channels will you use to reach prospective customers?</li>
<li>What marketing themes will you use to attract prospects?</li>
<li>What sales process will you use to turn prospects into buying customers?</li>
<li>How will you turn customers into repeat buyers?</li>
<li>What will be the average value of a sale?</li>
<li>What will be the average lifetime value of a customer?</li>
<li>How much revenue will you generate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will help you think through your marketing and sales strategy and will demonstrate to investors and lenders that you have a viable plan to generate revenue.</p>
<h3>Financial Projections</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/business-plan-financial-section_pagen_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial projections section</a> of your plan should estimate your company’s key financials for the next three to five years. It should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income statements</li>
<li>Balance sheets</li>
<li>Cash flow statements</li>
<li>Break-even analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Your statements for your first year should be broken down by quarter or by month. This will give you a clearer idea of how much money you’ll have coming in, how much expenses you’ll need to cover, and how much additional capital you need to fund your business plan. This will also provide the numbers you need to convince investors and lenders of your business model’s viability and your funding needs.</p>
<h3>Funding Needs</h3>
<p>Your funding needs section lays out your request for any financing you need to close the gap between your current capital and your projected expenses. It should state:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much you need</li>
<li>What you need it for</li>
<li>What length of time you need it for</li>
<li>How you plan to pay it back or otherwise compensate investors</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is designed both to help you estimate your needs and to help you persuade investors and lenders to support you. To make this section more persuasive, you may choose to supplement it with visual aids or a video dramatizing your vision of your company and your funding request.</p>
<p>Your business plan outlines your company’s roadmap to success. Your plan’s executive summary provides a brief overview of your plan. The remaining sections of your plan detail who your company is, what you sell, how your business is organized, how you plan to compete, your marketing and sales strategy, your financial projections and your funding needs. Taking the time to write your business plan will improve your ability to attract funding and increase your company’s odds of financial success.</p>
<p>The best business plans are living, breathing documents that grow and along with your business. They are not a document you write and never look at again. Keep it handy so you can easily measure your success or change course before its too late.</p>

<p>Having spent 20+ years in a very seasonal small business, I came to appreciate what it takes to manage finances during the busy seasons, bridge the slow seasons, and budget for the year. Fortunately, we had two or three particularly busy seasons during the year, so our annual revenues weren’t dependent upon the holiday season or the summer tourist season to keep us afloat.</p>
<p>It’s always very tempting to spend what you have when there is plenty of revenue coming in, but sticking to a budget and thinking of the big picture (you likely mapped out at the beginning of the year) is a better plan of attack.</p>
<p>If you’re business relies on a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/need-know-business-line-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business line of credit</a> or other financing—like a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/short-term-loans-a-quick-recap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-term business loan</a>—to help bridge from one season to the next, there are a few things you should consider when looking for financing; the first being, don’t wait until your busy season is over and you’re cash poor.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t wait until you are out of cash to borrow:</strong> Most lenders want to know that you have the revenue to support a loan when you <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/online-applications-small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your application</a>. They’ll likely want to look at several month’s worth of your business bank statements to determine if you have the cash flow to support the periodic payments. If you wait to apply until after the revenue stream has significantly dropped, and are in the middle of your bridge season, you will have some explaining to do to account for the lack of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t borrow today if you won’t have the cash flow to service the debt tomorrow:</strong> I believe borrowing to bridge busy seasons can be tricky and takes some extra thought. It’s important to make sure you will still have the revenue needed to make your periodic loan payments. If not, you’ll be damaging your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/have-you-checked-your-business-credit-profile-lately" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business credit profile</a> with every missed or late payment—making it more difficult to borrow the next time you need an infusion of cash.</li>
<li><strong>Borrow what you need—and no more:</strong> There are costs associated with borrowing, so borrowing more than what you’ll really need to get through your slow season can do more harm than good. And, expect to tighten the belt a little. Yes, you may need to cut back on some of the things you’d normally be doing during the busy season, but if you budget well, you’ll be able to bridge busy seasons with a minimal amount of pain. We used to set aside some cash when business was hopping in anticipation of projects we could do during the lull time to keep everyone busy.</li>
<li><strong>Plan ahead and don’t be reactionary:</strong> I’m a big proponent of looking at the year to <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/strategic-borrowing-benefits-to-increase-your-loan-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategically borrow</a> and planning in advance for the bridge seasons. This could mean putting aside some cash when cash flow is good to cover times when it’s not. I could also mean recognizing the need for financing and working to improve your business credit profile now, so you’ll have more options available to you when you need to borrow a little extra operating capital.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t ignore your personal credit score:</strong> For most small business owners, your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/lender-want-know-personal-credit-score" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal credit score</a> will be a factor when a lender is evaluating your business’ creditworthiness. The lower your score, the fewer options you will have when it’s time to borrow. Fortunately, we tend to impact the metrics we pay attention to. So, if you have a less-than-perfect personal credit score you can improve it by monitoring your score, correcting the areas that are pulling you down, and paying your personal obligations in a timely manner. Even if you have a poor score, with effort, you can make improvements. It won’t happen overnight, but it will happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prudently managing cash, financing, and operational needs during your busy season will help you keep your business profitable all year long. For many business, financing is a valuable tool that helps the do it. Just remember, thinking ahead and planning for the ups and downs of your business will help you avoid making reactionary decisions that can sometimes do more harm than good.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">

<p>This time of year many small business owners look at the next 12 months and make decisions about growth, how to pursue opportunities, and maybe even expansion plans. Unless they have the cash flow to fuel these business objectives, they also need to consider their options for accessing the capital they’ll need to find success.</p>
<p>Because, like their larger siblings, many small businesses rely on borrowed capital to fund growth and other initiatives, they should follow the example of larger companies that make funding business initiatives part of their annual strategic plan. With that in mind, here are three things you should consider as you put your plan together for the year:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evaluate your financial needs:</strong> It might not be enough to identify how much money you’ll need to fuel a new expansion or add a new product. You may also want to consider a timeline. Having six months vs. a few weeks or days to fund an important initiative can make a lot of difference in how and where you look, or the type of financing you seek. For example, if you need capital next month to launch an important initiative, an <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/sba-loans">SBA guaranteed loan</a> might not be an option because the approval process simply takes too long. On the other hand, if one of the loan guarantee programs is a good fit for your loan purpose and you have time to submit your application, go through the approval process, and wait for funds, it could be a great fit.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your business’ financial position:</strong> Although lenders might not ask it this way, most lenders want to know the answers to three questions: 1) Can you repay a loan? Will you repay a loan? And, will you be able to make repayment even if something unexpected happens? So in addition to the overall financial health of your business, you also need to be very aware of your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/business-credit">business credit profile</a> and your <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/why-is-your-personal-credit-score-part-of-a-business-loan-decision">personal credit history</a>—because every potential lender will be and the options available to your business will be impacted by what’s in your profiles. If you, or your business, have a less-than-perfect credit profile, thinking in advance can help you take actions to improve in anticipation of a loan application in the months ahead. And, although you may not be able to create a perfect profile in a few months, being proactive today will help you make progress that could benefit your loan application down the road. Remember, slow and steady wins this race.</li>
<li><strong>What type of financing will best accommodate your strategy?</strong> There are numerous options for financing available today. Depending on your need you might consider a traditional term loan, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/short-term-business-loans">a short-term business loan</a>, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-equipment-financing">equipment financing</a>, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/working-capital-financing">working capital financing</a>, or a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/need-know-business-line-credit">business line of credit</a>. Depending upon the nature of your business or how long your doors have been open, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> may even be an option. I’m a big proponent of matching the nature of the financing to the business need. By making financing a part of your strategic plan for the year, you’ll be better able to find the best match for what you want to do and what’s available to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking these steps might not guarantee you’ll have access the funds you’re looking for, but taking this approach and incorporating a financing plan within your strategy for the year will give you a leg up over scrambling to find the financing you need at the last minute. The world of small business financing has changed a lot over the last few years and there are, at least in my opinion, more options available to small businesses than ever before. With that being said, business owners need to be more savvy and strategic when it comes to choosing the financing options that will best meet their needs.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about all the financing options available to your business, we’ve published, what we consider, a fairly complete <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/small-business-loans">guide to small business financing</a>.

<h3><strong>Building a Business Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Thinking strategically and building a business strategy is an important exercise for all businesses—large and small. Unfortunately, many small business owners aren’t sure where to start, how a more strategic approach will impact their business, or if it’s even worth the time away from the important work of meeting the day-to-day challenges a small business owner faces. At least, I felt that way about my first business. I was so bogged down with the day to day, I didn’t take any time to be strategic—and, looking back, I think it hurt my business.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that thinking strategically about your business is as much about the process as it is about having a fully baked business plan. In other words, I don’t think it’s something you do at the beginning of the year with the only goal being a well-crafted set of strategic objectives; but rather something you do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>With that said, what does “regular” mean?</p>
<h3><strong>Take Time to Think About Your Business</strong></h3>
<p>Several years ago I interviewed an author, for a podcast I was doing, who later became a good friend. When I met him, he had turned around eight struggling businesses and had written a book about it: <a href="http://crosspartnership.com/just-run-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Run It! Running an Exceptional Business is Easier than You Think</a>. Dick Cross had a commonsense philosophy for running a business that really resonated with me. And, although he had been the CEO of eight larger companies, he wasn’t a tech CEO. The companies he turned around where traditional businesses like manufacturers or distributors making and selling products like batteries, bolts and nuts, or furniture. It didn’t take long to recognize how a small business owner could leverage his approach to build a successful small business.</p>
<p>He felt like the CEO, or in this case the business owner, had a very important role that couldn’t be ignored for a business to be successful. It’s more than being the primary sales person, managing production, or building a thoughtful marketing plan. He argued that thinking about the business was an important part of that role and suggested that one uninterrupted hour each week to do nothing but think about your business was vital to success. He also felt like it was difficult to do.</p>
<h3><strong>An Hour a Week?</strong></h3>
<p>Since I met Dick, I’ve spoken to a lot of business owners about this idea who say, “I’m always thinking about my business.”</p>
<p>Having been a business owner a time or two, I admit, I felt like I was always thinking about my business too—it just wasn’t very productive. I was thinking about it while I was meeting with customers, answering the phone, doing the books, or otherwise working in the business. I wasn’t in an environment that would allow me to think about and capture new ideas, let alone think about the best way to execute on them.</p>
<p>Dick suggests that taking the time to “just think” is challenging because business leaders feel like they always need to be doing something, and don’t consider “thinking” as doing something. But it really is. What’s more, he would argue it’s the most important thing you can do. If you’d like to know more about how to get started, here are six things you can start doing this week:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t be afraid to take it slow:</strong> Although the objective is to take an hour a week, it might be hard to jump in with both feet this week. Start with 20 or 30 minutes of dedicated time to think about your business and build up to the hour. Once you start to feel differently about it, you’ll want to gradually increase the time you spend with this powerful exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Shut down your computer:</strong> Don’t catch up on email, review reports, or otherwise allow yourself to be distracted by the computer. Put your email notifications on do not disturb and put your computer to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Turn off your cell phone:</strong> We live in an age when one of the single biggest distractions for all of us is the cell phone buzzing, chirping, or beeping at us to pick it up. I’ve watched couples in restaurants waiting for their meals without speaking a word because they’re both so engaged by the little screen they’re holding in their hands. I’ve also watched people in important business meetings get distracted by their cell phones that they miss important parts of the conversation. Just turn it off and put it in a drawer so it doesn’t take you mind away from thinking about your business.</li>
<li><strong>Shut the door to your office or find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed:</strong> If you’re noticing a theme here, the suggestions so far are definitely in the “do not disturb” category. The goal is to find a time where you can be uninterrupted and left alone to get into the zone. 30 to 60 minutes will feel like an eternity in the beginning, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
<li><strong>Put it on your calendar:</strong> Treat this time like you would any important meeting—even though it’s a meeting with yourself and your thoughts. In my experience, I realize that if I don’t schedule time for an exercise like this, it doesn’t happen.</li>
<li><strong>Capture your thoughts:</strong> It won’t take doing this too many times before you start to have some great ideas. We’ve all heard the saying, “A goal not written is a wish.” The same holds true for great ideas. If you don’t capture them, it will be really hard to execute on an idea you don’t remember. Write it down or record it on an audio recorder—just make sure you capture the idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be prepared. You might get a few odd looks from your employees if they see you sitting at your desk “thinking,” but don’t let that dissuade you. The value of setting time aside to think strategically about your business every week can help you take your small business to the next level. If nothing else, it will help you keep that strategic plan top of mind for the next twelve months. Don’t forget, we tend to impact those things we spend regular time with; the same is true for your yearly strategic plan.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Entrepreneurs looking to have their best year ever should listen to Lisa Hendrickson. Her advice for road mapping success will help any entrepreneur find success. She recommends:</p><ol><li>Access your current state results—you need to know where you are before you can decide where you want to go</li><li>Define success—it's not enough to want to be successful, you need to identify what success will look like to you</li><li>Turn you idea of success into a business purpose—what difference in the world do you wan to make with your business?

If you do it right, you can become a change agent and build a successful and thriving business.</p>		</div>
		
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong> Five Steps to Supercharged Results for the Change Agent Entrepreneur</strong></h3>
<p>You became an entrepreneur because you knew that you could do your thing better than anyone else out there. You knew that you could make something great because you believe in yourself and have that special magic to bring your idea into reality. With the approaching new year, it’s time to assess and review what is bringing us closer to our ideas and ideals and to do away with what isn’t. Achievement comes naturally to the parts of the business that play to our strengths while we struggle with the rest.   Its time to make that “left turn at Albuquerque” like Bugs Bunny said and change direction on what’s not working.  Blowing the lid off obstacles will open up a whole new aspect of achievement, excitement and newness that could just be the kind of gamechanger that you’re looking for in the new year.</p>
<h3><strong>Entrepreneurs are Masterful Change Agents</strong></h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs are masterful agents of change—the premise of entrepreneurship isn’t about doing things the same, it’s inherently about making change.  Supercharging your results means that you’ve got to change from your current state to get to the next. This means there are no sacred cows in the business and that you’re able to jettison what’s weighing down the business down instead of lifting it up. It’s the essence of change.</p>
<h3><strong>Possibility and Change</strong></h3>
<p>As entrepreneurs, possibility is our go-go juice.  We love the thought of achieving all the goals on our checklists because then, only then, will we be able to have next level results—more money, more exposure, more satisfaction, more time off. We can imagine an entire office of well-trained employees who can handle the workload while we’re enjoying winter vacations on a secluded tropical island. They won’t ever text or call because they’re so confident and capable of managing things and they simply don’t need us to run the day to day operations. Can’t you just see it?  All the things that we wish for when we see the clean slate presented by a new year coupled with the vision of the future where we’ve achieved our great outcomes makes an entrepreneur’s success meter rise up like a terrier’s prance when they have won “best in show.” The possibility of the future is enticing and draws us in every time, the feeling of success is palpable—but how do we get from where we are today to where we want to go?</p>
<h3><strong>The Color of Kool-Aid</strong></h3>
<p>An entrepreneur has to believe more than anyone else in the change that they are making in the world by creating their company, their products and by bringing their community to the mix.  We believe so much in what we’re creating that sometimes we don’t know that we might need to make a change along the way that makes the whole thing better.  Think of it this way, its not that you drank your own Kool-Aid and now you don’t believe in it, it’s that the Kool-Aid you drank was one color and now it might be time to introduce another color. Rarely, if at all, past a certain moment in time, a pure vision and the purist don’t stand in step with the outcomes required. Change requires introspection and a willingness to evolve.</p>
<h3><strong>Roadmapping for Road Tripping to Supercharged Results</strong></h3>
<p>After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Americans were enchanted by the idea of homesteading—leaving the East and to set out West to put a stake in the ground and claim their fortune of land and legacy.  Westward Expansion like entrepreneurship means believing more in the vision of what will come rather than what you have now.  Just like the settlers of the Western Expansion, entrepreneurs need a roadmap from the current state to the next level—consider this your roadmap to the next level.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-170620 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rocketforweb.jpg?resize=600%2C564&#038;ssl=1" alt="Have 2018 Be Your Best Year Ever | Lisa Hendrickson for OnDeck" width="600" height="564" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rocketforweb.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Rocketforweb.jpg?resize=300%2C282&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><strong>Step One: Assess Current State Results.</strong></h3>
<p>Getting clear about what you and your team have achieved in closing the year is a key yet often overlooked step for success. Knowing where you are in the growth journey of your company and the results that the current company efforts are putting on the scoreboard will give you a baseline for measuring the improvements for the upcoming year.  Assess financial results, operational efficiencies, customer service wins and losses, brand awareness, marketing effectiveness and any other aspects of the business that you seek to improve upon. If you are not able to measure, assess, evaluate and correct current state results because you haven’t made the systems to do so, make it a priority now to devise ways to evaluate your company’s performance in a consistent and timely manner.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Two: Define Success.</strong></h3>
<p>What is success? So often we assume that success is what everybody expects, not necessarily what we believe makes us successful as an entrepreneur and as a person.  Have you spent time quietly thinking and writing down what your personal definition of success is?  If you haven’t defined what success means to you, no matter what results you and your team achieve, you might not feel fulfilled. Why? Because success is personal and until you define this for yourself, you aren’t able to pinpoint exactly where you want your entrepreneurial venture to take you personally. As the leader of your team, if you’re uncertain of the definition of success, do you think your employees can align behind the idea? Max De Pree, ex-CEO of Herman Miller and author of many best-selling books on business leadership said, “the first responsibility of a leader is to define reality.” Agreed.  Defining creates a tangible state.  Tangibility will bring your idea of success from ephemeral to achievable.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Three: Turn Your Idea of Success into a Business Purpose.</strong></h3>
<p>Outside of making money, what is the purpose of your business? Jack Welsh famously said his mission at GE was to make the company number one or number two in the markets it participated in.  I’d challenge the notion that this was a mission—I believe it to be an objective.  They are different.  An objective is an intended outcome from a project or a plan. A mission or purpose is something that is open ended and has a multitude of ways that it can be enacted upon.  Here’s the Starbuck’s mission statement: To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one cup, one person, one neighborhood at a time.” Helping others ensures that you receive the same for yourself. Think of it like the rule of karma or reaping what you sow—helping others through a purposeful approach in business will create meaning and satisfaction for you, your employees, and the people that you serve. Now more than ever, expressing your purpose to a hyper-connected world brings your brand to life and has customers make an emotional connection with you and your company.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Four: Align Business Habits with Purpose, Goals and Desired Outcomes.</strong></h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs are visionaries.  We can see the future when we close our eyes. We turn vision into drive and drive causes actions.  Actions produce results.  It’s easy for entrepreneurs to connect the purpose to an idea and an idea to action steps but its harder for us to share this process with our employees.  Too often small business owners and entrepreneurs expect their staff to just “get it.” Reducing the disconnect between what you envision and what your employees produce can help minimize the risk of failed campaigns and poor business results. By creating company habits like a morning check in or weekly reporting of results, we’re able to take our ideas and see the actions and results in the day to day business efforts.  When putting in the right business habits we foster goal-oriented action.</p>
<p>Knowing the difference between a purpose, a goal and an outcome gives entrepreneurs the fortitude to break down the complexity that has us often abandon change agent projects because they get too cumbersome. When we feel the purpose and goals in our bones, then our natural drive towards the outcomes helps us change our personal behaviors.  When we make change personally, then we can institute change inside of the business.  Aligned actions produce supercharged results.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Five: Make Your Business Goals Personal to Your Employees.</strong></h3>
<p>In the book “Good to Great” Jim Collins writes about how high performing companies become that way. His keen observation about motivation has stuck with me many years after initially reading the book.  To paraphrase Collins said “You don’t need to motivate employees.  They already come to you motivated.  The idea is to not demotivate them.” So how do we do that as small business owners and entrepreneurs?  We create projects that ask employees to align their own goals with our business goals.  Let’s say you have an employee who has wanted to ride their bike across the state raising money for charity but have never done it.  What if you could bring together a business outcome with this personal outcome? What if you helped her achieve her goal while she helped the business achieve its goals? Do you think you’d create a sense of urgency and connectedness between the business goals and your employee’s personal one? Once the goals are achieved, don’t you think you’d have an employee who felt real ownership of the brand, her work and a sense of reciprocity that will help drive her to step outside of her comfort zone to produce change agent results?  (Hint: your answers to all of these questions is yes.).</p>
<h3><strong>Map Legend.</strong></h3>
<p>A few clarifying points to help you navigate your way to the next level. Think of this as a mix of personal and business tools that help declutter your journey as a change agent entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Connection Between Strategy and Execution is the Plan.</em></strong></p>
<p>The only difference between a vision and a pipedream is action.  Connecting vision and execution are key to having your entrepreneurial vision be realized. Helping your employees move from vision to execution is the project plan.  This is an important part of your change map and its often overlooked. If you aren’t using a project plan or project documentation in your small business, you are missing an opportunity to offset work with tools that can help you see potential trouble around the corner. Usually the block for small business owners is learning a new software and implementing that tool inside the business.  Know that planning for the amount of time it will take to introduce and implement a new tool will be about twice as long as the salesperson testifies to and that until proficient at using the tool, your team will grumble about it and be slower at achieving the task.  Knowing this ahead of time helps you plan for the implementation. Be bold and strike out with new efficiencies.  They absolutely will help you to free up time, reduce errors and see problems before they become big ones.</p>
<p><strong><em>Give Up “The Next Shiny Penny” Syndrome</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Chasing after the next shiny penny is just that, chasing after something that after awhile just isn’t that interesting or valuable to you and your organization, worse it’s a distraction that never seems to fully pay off.  It’s a vicious cycle where we entrepreneurs see opportunities everywhere and we wind up chasing the shiny penny because we think it’s the Treasure of the Sierra Madre and this time, this time, it’s the one….we confuse the possibility of the business with the shortcut of the next shiny penny.  Giving up the distraction of the next shiny penny brings sanity to the larger idea that we’re striving to achieve.</p>
<p>Following the Five Steps of A Change Agent Entrepreneur roadmap will get you on the pathway to making changes in your business and your business results but just like driving on the thruway, there’s always rules of the road.</p>
<h3><strong>Rules of the Road. </strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>Make no more than three big goals per quarter.</em></span>  If you’re a small business where resources are scheduled tight and there’s not a lot of wiggle room in the calendar, you should be hyper-focused on achieving three key goals at most per quarter. Your organization most likely isn’t equipped to achieve more than that given the constraints.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>Have a quarterly goal visual display on every project plan or project document</em>.</span>  Goals will seem ephemeral or just forgotten if they’re spoken about at a meeting and then not integrated into the day to day work that the business does.  Find ways to have team members relate to the goal as something that is top of mind, not something that’s remembered towards the end of the quarter or around bonus time.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>You cannot improve that which you do not measure. </em></span>Having a means to determine what your game is, what is a measure for success helps you and your team understand what is working or what programs or campaigns need improvement. Measuring and assessing in real time allows you and your team to make pivots and adjustments so that results aren’t examined and learned from after the fact.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>There is no such thing as common sense. </em></span>If it was so common, then everyone would have it, no? Do not expect people to understand what you want.  You have to show people what you want and then develop that sensibility within your employees. Those are the elements of brand by the way. That special sauce that only your company knows how to make.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>What you believe you achieve.</em></span>  If you believe it with passion and know it in your bones that what you’re out to accomplish is achievable, the people will come along.  Whether its your employees or the public, if you’ve got the confidence and fire in the belly to make it happen, the world will accommodate you and your personal definition of success.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><em>Hope is not a strategy</em>.</span>  Hoping that things will get done or get better without taking an action is like thinking that you’ll be able to run a marathon by watching one on TV. It just takes more than what you’re doing now to make changes.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
<p>“A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step” (Lao Tzu) and that wisdom applies to any kind of actions made by you, the Change Agent Entrepreneur.  Schedule step one on the roadmap in your calendar and keep that appointment with yourself. You will see how the steps unfold for you.  Yes, it might feel uncomfortable at first, but making these changes in your business will help you focus on achievement of next level results.</p>
<p>All pioneers and Change Agent Entrepreneurs step out into the unknown and learn a new territory, find ways to overcome obstacles and prevail in a new landscape.  Defining your own path and taking it on with whole-heartedness, smarts and a plan in hand will have you ahead of the pack and achieving inspired and supercharged results.  Onward into the future!</p>

Some business owners, especially those with long-standing </span><span style="font-weight: 400">relationships with their banks, sometimes have questions about </span><span style="font-weight: 400">short-term loans.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What business needs are a good fit for short-term financing?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first question you should ask yourself when you begin the process of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">securing financing for your business is: what is your business need? Your </span><span style="font-weight: 400">answer to this question will determine what type of financing and loan </span><span style="font-weight: 400">term is appropriate for your business. Do you need the funds quickly? Do </span><span style="font-weight: 400">you need the funds for a project that will capture additional ROI in a short </span><span style="font-weight: 400">period of time? Different types of financing are appropriate for different </span><span style="font-weight: 400">business needs.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169794 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=1616%2C530&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1616" height="530" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?w=1616&amp;ssl=1 1616w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Examples of business needs for short-term financing to fuel growth <span style="font-weight: 400">or increase ROI are: a physical expansion or renovation, hiring a new </span><span style="font-weight: 400">employee, buying inventory quickly, or purchasing equipment. These and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">similar initiatives can help your business growth long-term, and generally </span><span style="font-weight: 400">provide realized gains fairly quickly. The loan term should match the useful </span><span style="font-weight: 400">life of the asset just as you wouldn’t take a 30-year auto loan for your car, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">even if the payments were smaller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What costs make sense? APR vs. Cents on the Dollar</b></span></h2>
<p>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is only one way to compare your financing <span style="font-weight: 400">options. APR represents the total interest cost, including fees, as an annualized rate which may appear higher than the actual overall cost of a short term loan. In many cases, the APR of a short-term loan can be much higher than the APR for a longer-term loan. But when you consider other factors, such as total cost of the loan and your business need, you can see a short-term loan could be a better fit for your business. As you see in the example below, the shorter-term loan has a higher APR, but a lower overall cost than the longer term loan with the lower APR.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>Let’s run some numbers to illustrate the point.</i></b></span></h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169795 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=1666%2C896&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1666" height="896" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?w=1666&amp;ssl=1 1666w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C413&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C551&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>It really depends on the term length of your financing:</i></b></span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169796" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=1608%2C674&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1608" height="674" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?w=1608&amp;ssl=1 1608w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=768%2C322&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=1024%2C429&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1608px) 100vw, 1608px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>Another metric to consider is the overlap between your </i></b><b><i>periodic payments and the returns on your investment.</i></b></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For example:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> If you are planning to use your loan to make an equipment purchase, then the equipment you buy might start generating</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">returns immediately. In that case, consider comparing your daily or weekly payment on the loan to the daily or weekly income your investment will generate. That difference represents your net gain from the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the short-run</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Calculating ROI</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Time Is Money:</strong></span> Traditional lenders, like banks, can take weeks to process your business loan application and for you to receive the funds. Short-term online lenders, often have an answer to your loan application in under an hour and funds in your account as quickly as the next business day. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports it takes the average small business owner 33 hours to apply for a loan at the bank.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Considering ROI When You Borrow</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For short-term loans with a defined ROI target, APR might not be as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">important a metric as the total cost of the loan relative to the return on </span><span style="font-weight: 400">investment. Particularly when purchasing inventory or equipment, the total </span><span style="font-weight: 400">cost of financing might be a relevant number when calculating ROI. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the total cost of financing, in addition to APR, when calculating </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ROI can be a good way to determine if the financing being considered will </span><span style="font-weight: 400">help meet your ROI objective or become too expensive—even with a lower </span><span style="font-weight: 400">periodic payment or lower APR.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some business owners are concerned the with higher periodic payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400">often associated with a short-term loan. If your business has the cash flow to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">sustain the payments, the lower total dollar cost of capital can be cheaper, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the long run, with a short-term loan.

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>EXAMPLE: <span style="color: #000082">How Can a Short-Term Loan Affect My Cash Flow?</span></b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>A laundromat buys 10 new washing machines.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the day they install the new machines, they generate $540 per day ($3 per cycle,180 cycles per day). If they bought the machines with a 6-month loan for $10,000 at 1.19 Cents on the Dollar (CoD), their daily payment would be $95/day. So, over the short-term, their net gain would be $540-$95 (minus the cost of the water and electricity to run the machines).</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169799 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=1372%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1372" height="650" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?w=1372&amp;ssl=1 1372w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=1024%2C485&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Once they’ve made all 126 payments they get to keep all $540 (minus utilities) for the remaining lifetime of the machines. That might be more appealing to some business owners than a loan with a longer payback, because they might be willing to pay more in the short-term in exchange for a greater ROI, faster.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>57% of small businesses choose a shorter-term, higher-APR loan over a longer-term lower-APR loan in order to minimize total fees &amp; expenses*</b></span></h2>
</blockquote>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Choosing The Right Lender</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it’s time for you to make a decision on choosing a lender, there are some things you should consider. </span><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>Here are some Questions you should be asking yourself.</b></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>What do I need the money for?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing the business need the funding will help you with is the most important step in your search for financing. The answer to this question will help the lender get you the right offer, as well as help you make the best financing decision for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>How much money do I really need?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Know the actual amount of funds you need. There are costs associated with borrowing, so borrowing more than you really need can become very expensive. What’s more, not every lender will offer you the full amount you request, and if you have good credit, some lenders may offer you too much.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>How quickly do I need the money?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you need the money tomorrow, this week, or next month? The time frame in which you need the funds can drastically cut or shape the options that work for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>What types of financing can I qualify for?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your personal credit score, business credit profile, cash flow, time in business, annual revenue, and several other factors are all considered by lenders to determine the funds and terms you will qualify for. Know the minimum requirements for each lender before you put in an application. That way, you won’t waste your time applying with lenders that won’t work with your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>Do I have all the information I need to make a decision?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The simplest way to know you’re getting the best financing for your business is to have all of the information beforehand. Do your research, so you spend your time applying with lenders who will lend to you and will meet your business needs.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We <span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>LOVE</strong></span> mom and pop shops. In honor of Mom and Pop Business Owner’s Day (March 29), we wanted to share what it takes to be a small business owner. So, we asked <strong>over 100 business owners</strong> some questions about how they run their business, get customers in the door,  deal with the tough issues, and see if they had any advice from small business owners they&#8217;d like to share. Some answers were not surprising, while others got us thinking about how we, as small business advocates, can better help small business owners get to the next level.</span></p>
<p>Here is the advice from small business owners they shared with us.</p>
<h3><b>1: Is your customer service strategy a key driver in the overall success of your business?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Over 91%</strong> </span>said YES! This answer made us so happy because it proved to us that <strong>small businesses succeed more when they show their customers some love</strong>. Customers may choose the big stores and brands for convenience, but they also know that when they shop small, they will be taken care of. And who doesn’t prefer that?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yes-no.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-157821"><img class="center aligncenter wp-image-157821" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yes-no.jpg?resize=377%2C369&#038;ssl=1" alt="small business marketing" width="377" height="369" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yes-no.jpg?w=732&amp;ssl=1 732w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yes-no.jpg?resize=300%2C293&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h3><b>2: What was your approach to building a customer service strategy?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers we got to this questions were fantastic and well thought out, so instead of adding our comments in here, we’ll let <strong>your fellow business owners</strong> do the talking. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>1: Over-communicate, so the customer knows we are thinking of them. 2: Make sure they understand what they are getting, and know all the options available. 3: Fast and accurate communication. 4: Once they get the product make sure they are satisfied, or do what is needed to [make sure] they are satisfied.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong> </span>&#8211; Sunnyvale, CA</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>[We want to make sure] every single one of our customers is important and should feel that way when they walk in the door.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; East Aurora, NY</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>We use a three step approach: Visibility = frequent client contact Credibility = performance reporting Profitability = demonstrate a tangible ROI.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Houston, TX</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently interviewed OnDeck’s Director of Customer Service, so </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/how-to-build-a-strong-customer-service-experience?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=momandpopday&amp;utm_content=article1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click here if you want to learn more about this topic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>3: How do you find new customers? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It did not surprise us that word of mouth is the <strong>most popular method of new customer acquisition</strong> for a mom and pop shop at <span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>87%</strong></span>. For most small businesses, there is nothing more powerful than a word of mouth recommendation. Not too surprising either, social media marketing came in 2nd place at <strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">69%</span></strong>.</span></p>

<h3><b>4: What is your small business marketing philosophy? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is a challenge for many small business owners. It may <strong>require them to think differently</strong> and draw upon all of their acumen, creativity, and their understanding of their customers&#8217; wants and needs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These small business marketing mavens have hit the nail on the head. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Go as deep and as wide as possible into multiple customers.  Serve their requirements, not those of companies we sell for.<strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">”</span></strong> &#8211; El Paso, TX</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Defining our end-game and strategizing our budget, search ads, display ads, social ads. Our agents are to research and prospect potential customers daily.<strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">”</span></strong> &#8211; Inman, SC</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Provide high value and a win-win for my customers. Marketing is about engaging people and building lasting relationships with them.<strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">”</span></strong> &#8211; Vancouver, BC</span></p></blockquote>

<h3><b>6: What is the biggest challenge you have to marketing your business?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that not all businesses are the same. Every business and industry has its own challenges, but when it comes to marketing, <strong>four main challenges kept coming up</strong>: cost, time, bad reviews, and know-how.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">Cost</span></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">:</span></strong> The majority of business owners mention cost as the main issue to their marketing plans. Here’s a </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/12-free-online-smb-management-resources-you-cant-afford-to-ignore?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=momandpopday&amp;utm_content=article2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of free tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you grow your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>Time:</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A global theme for small business owners is a lack of time. This won’t change, but </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-101-ebook-take-back-your-time?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=momandpopday&amp;utm_content=article3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on your time management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skills may help you squeeze a little more out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>Bad Reviews:</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s never easy to overcome bad reviews, especially when you’re a small business, but these days you can’t avoid them. Depending on the situation, you can </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/negative-yelp-reviews-heres-deal?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=momandpopday&amp;utm_content=article4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">respond or leave it alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you choose to respond, make sure you do it respectfully and use evidence to support how you worked to solve the issue. And, don’t forget to offer them an incentive to try your business again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>Know-how:</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Creating a successful marketing plan may seem like a stretch if you’ve never done it before, but it’s not as hard as it might seem. With a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/your-quick-guide-for-planning-a-marketing-strategy?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=momandpopday&amp;utm_content=article5">few easy steps</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ll be on your way to marketing gold. </span></p>
<h3><b>7: What do you do to keep your employees motivated?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to know what small business owners can do, with their limited time and resources to keep their employees motivated and passionate. We received a lot of one-word answers: the big “C” &#8211; cash, but we all know <strong>employees stay at and love their jobs for more reasons than just money</strong>. If you’re compensating people enough to take the topic of pay off the table, these are the ideas identified that help keep employees motivated and happy:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">“</span></strong>Treat them right and take interest in their personal lives and help them personally any way we can. Make them feel like family.<strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">”</span></strong> &#8211; Washington Court House, OH</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">“</span></strong>We joke around a lot. We try to do fun things after hours together too.<strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">”</span></strong> &#8211; Elizabethtown, KY</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">“</span></strong>Be flexible when it comes to time off for family/school etc. commitments.<strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">”</span> </strong>&#8211; Fort Collins, CO</p></blockquote>

<h3> <b>8: How do you approach letting an employee go?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting an employee go is <strong>the least fun and the hardest part of being a small business owner</strong>. There are many theories out there regarding the best way to go about letting an employee go. Here’s how your fellow business owners approach these situations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Be upfront, honest, and treat the situation with kindness. Hopefully parting is in the best interest of all involved.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Kula, HI</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Cautiously, I make sure I have plenty of reasons and then do it with dignity.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Feeding Hills, MA</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>We try to fire quickly and sometimes are little slower then we&#8217;d like. Having bad employees hurts the entire company, but sometimes it’s necessary to prune the branches from time to time to allow the tree to flourish.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Baltimore, MD</span></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>9: In a family business, is there such thing as keeping business and personal separate?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Over 56%</strong></span> of the small business owners we spoke with <strong>work with one or more members of their family</strong>. Their businesses have an added challenge of trying to keep their personal lives separate from their business lives&#8230; if that’s even possible. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Very difficult to keep business and personal separate &#8211; always seem to talk business even though we try very hard to keep separate.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Casa Grande, AZ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>It&#8217;s hard to do. We just go with the flow on that.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Fort Collins, CO</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Only positive work issues are discussed outside of business hours.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span> &#8211; Phoenix, AZ</span></p></blockquote>
