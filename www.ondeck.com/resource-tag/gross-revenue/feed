								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gross Revenue Vs. Net Revenue Explained:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simply put your </span><b>gross revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is your earnings </span><b><i>before</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> you deduct your expenses and your </span><b>net revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is your earnings </span><b><i>after</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> you subtract your expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding the difference between your gross revenue and your net revenue will tell you how successful you are at controlling your expenses&#8230; and generating profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s important to understand all the costs associated with doing business, including the cost of goods sold, the lease on where you do business, employee payroll, and even incidental expenses like paper supplies or your utility bill.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is this difference important?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Often investors will be more interested in your gross revenue because it shows your businesses ability to generate sales and potential for growth. If your business opened a new location gross revenue can be a far more useful metric than net revenue because it indicates potential, without the clouded judgement of the one time cost of opening that new location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This does not mean you can afford to discount the importance of net revenue (your actual profits). This is the best way for you, as a business owner, to make decisions of cost and worth. Even if a product or service is bringing in a lot of revenue, you can see after deducting all the expenses associated with that product, whether or not  it is a profitable product or service for your business. Often you will be able see where you can and can not cut costs to make your business more efficient—and where you have greater profit-generating opportunities. </span></p>
<p><b>How is this relevant to business financing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most lenders, from your local bank to the SBA to online lenders like OnDeck, look at Gross Revenue as a minimum qualification requirement. This means, like most investors they want to know what you potential for bringing in capital to your business. This helps lenders determine how much money is appropriate to lend to a particular business while using your</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/build-a-strong-business-credit-profile"> <span style="font-weight: 400">business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/why-is-your-personal-credit-score-part-of-a-business-loan-decision"> <span style="font-weight: 400">personal credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and</span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/cash-flow-business-owners-know"> <span style="font-weight: 400">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to determine your ability to pay the loan back. You’ll want to make sure you understand your net revenue to determine how easily or difficult it will be to service the debt.</span></p>
<p>I hope this help you understand the differences between gross revenue vs. net revenue.</p>
