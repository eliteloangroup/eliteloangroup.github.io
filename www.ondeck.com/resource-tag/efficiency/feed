								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In addition to all the other responsibilities you and the average small business owner has, sales—or at least managing the sales process—is probably at the top of your list; because without sales, nothing else happens.</p>
<p>Like many small business owners, among all the other things you do you probably do a lot of your own sales, making it important to take the time spent in sales into consideration when making sales calls. Because of the demands of all those other responsibilities, you want to spend enough time, but not too much time.</p>
<p>Understanding that It can be difficult to connect with a customer, or potential customer, on a meaningful level without spending some time to connect on a personal level, discuss a plan of action, and listen to their future plans, it’s very important to focus on maximizing every minute you spend selling to customers and future customers to gain the most value out of every interaction.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if you’re able to communicate that what  you offer has a very good chance it will provide value to their business, they will be more inclined to listen. The trick is to make sure your customer interactions also add value to you and your business.</p>
<p>Let’s examine some ways to make every second count with potential customers and landing the sale you hope to land without spending too much time on the phone, so you can get back to running your business.</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #0074ff;">
			<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>You Must Have a Clear Message</strong></span></h3>		</div>
		
<p>There’s a good chance you may have heard that one of the keys in business and in interviews is a firm handshake. Even if the individual is smiling and dressed professionally, it doesn’t make a good impression if you have a weak handshake. It feels either indecisive or questionable in some way. Many people believe that a firm handshake represents a clear and focused mind.</p>
<p>Although there is no handshake in a sales call over the phone the same thing can happen. Because it’s easy to get off-message, it’s important to stay focused on the purpose of the call. There are some salespeople who might believe that the best approach is to relate to the potential customer before getting to the sale. They might suggest making small-talk about sports, or the neighborhood that they live in—but as a small business owner, time is an incredibly valuable commodity. With that in mind, there’s nothing wrong with getting to the point.</p>
<p>An introduction is fine, but keep it short. Let the person on the other side of the line know you can help them, and point out how you can help as soon as possible. You can even say something like, “I know you’re busy, so I’ll get to the point”, to set expectations right up front. You want him or her to understand that you respect his or her time and that you aren’t just trying to rush through everything. Regardless of what you’re selling, whether you make fliers, websites, or providing financing—let it be known, and make it clear from the start.</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #83eece;">
			<p>Here are a few key points to consider whenever you connect with a potential customer.</p><ul><li><strong>Take control of the call up front</strong>. Clearly explain to your customer how long you expect the call to take and what you plan on discussing. Be clear about what you are offering, how it can help them, and why they should work with you.  The unknown is what scares people, and often, if you simply tell them upfront what to expect, they will be more comfortable moving ahead with the process.</li><li><strong>Ask specific questions</strong> that will allow you to learn about their business needs in the most efficient manner. Make sure these questions help you understand their needs, how they think about your product or service, and what are the most important challenges your business can solve for them. Open ended questions are great when you have all the time in the world, but as a busy business owner, you need to stay on track and guide them to get as much relevant information you can.  Don’t wing it, have your questions ready to go!<strong> </strong></li><li><strong>Creating urgency</strong> can increase your chances of closing the deal, but can also engage customers upfront to want to continue the process. By taking control of the call you can quickly understand what they are looking for and can create a sense of urgency. Once you know what they might be looking for, it’s easier to position our solutions as the response to what they need.  How long have you been thinking about doing ABC?  How great will it feel to do ABC?  Make it real, allow them to visualize how their concerns are being met or their problem is being solved with your help.</li><li><strong>Show emotion</strong> on your calls because business is personal. We tend to buy from people, not companies. Be truly excited about the opportunity to help your customers.  There are likely several options out there and your competition is probably reaching out them too, so it’s important you create a great experience from the start.  Use phrases like “wow that is great…” or “yes, I can see why this is so important to you…”  Once you connect with them you will be able to easily go over why your product or service is the best option available and they will be more likely to want to work with you.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>With every kind of sales call (in person or over the phone), there might be hesitation. Taking control of the call from the start, asking the right questions up front, creating urgency, and showing emotion can lead you down the path of success when speaking with potential customers—and, getting through it efficiently enough so you can move on to the next task your business requires.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are probably familiar with the saying “time is money,” but you may not really understand how true it is. Studies show that the average executive wastes an hour of work time each day looking for missing information. The Small Business Administration reports that many small businesses cannot properly serve their customers because of disorganized paperwork.</p>
<p>By contrast, an organization that is both efficient and effective is an organization that delivers the goods and services its customers want and need in a timely fashion and at prices they are willing to pay. The time, effort and money spent maintaining well-organized operations are a good investment in the profitability of your company.</p>
<h3>Disorganization Can Be Costly</h3>
<p>As a small business owner, time is often at a premium. You may recognize the value of being organized but believe that you’re just too busy keeping your business running to devote the time necessary to getting organized. However, this sort of thinking fails to take into account the costs that your business is likely suffering due to lack of organization.</p>
<p>According to a 2011 Hiring Trends survey conducted by Express Employment Professionals, management level employees lose as much as nine work hours each week because of excess clutter on their desks or in their offices. Translated into dollars <span class="fr-style">—</span> this means that a manager earning $50,000 annually costs the company more than $11,000 each year due to disorganization. That’s hardly pocket change.</p>
<p>Disorganization can lead to lost revenue in other areas. Lost files or equipment must be replaced. Cash flow is often critical in small businesses. Disorganized records often lead to delayed invoicing, and resulting delays in receiving payments.</p>
<p>Disorganization also has a negative impact on current or potential clients. Rightly or wrongly, clients perceive disorganized operations as being unprepared to handle their business. Your company’s finished product may be spectacular, but you may never have the opportunity to demonstrate that excellence if would-be customers perceive your company as unprofessional.</p>
<h3><strong>Keeping Crucial Documents and Files Organized and Accessible</strong></h3>
<p>An essential element to the smooth operation of your business is ensuring that crucial records are readily accessible. Such records include current contracts, banking information and financial reports. The key to maintaining ready access to crucial records is creating an efficient categorization and filing system. Bear in mind that many documents can be scanned into electronic files to reduce paperwork and for easier transmission among employees and clients alike. The IRS accepts scanned documents, including receipts, for tax filing purposes.</p>
<p>The specifics of your company’s filing system will of course be unique to your business circumstances. However, there are several features common to most effective organization and filing systems <span class="fr-style">—</span> both paper-based and electronic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform filing procedures – alphabetical, chronological, geographical, etc.</li>
<li>Controlled access – either by physical security or electronic password</li>
<li>Clear, logical categories, including cross-referencing of files and documents as necessary</li>
<li>Expandable and flexible to accommodate changing conditions</li>
<li>Systematic purging of obsolete records</li>
</ul>
<p>One frequently-overlooked aspect of records organization associated with hard copies is establishing a means of keeping track of files in use. The absence of such a system often leads to “missing” files that often turn out to be on top of someone’s desk. One option for keeping track of files in use for a paper filing system is to post a sign-up sheet by the filing cabinet or other storage area that lists the file being used along with the name of the person using the file.</p>
<h3>Employing the KISS Principle for Efficient Operations</h3>
<p>While retaining crucial records is important, unnecessary duplication of records and the resulting clutter represent significant hurdles for efficient operations. Employing the KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Samuel or Susan) can make a significant impact on helping your business run more smoothly.</p>
<p>You may hesitate to undergo a purging process due to an understandable fear of discarding documents that are actually important or necessary. The following list provides a good guideline for which documents should be retained, along with how long they should be retained. Specific questions pertaining to document retention should be addressed to your company’s accounting department or a certified public accountant:</p>
<ul>
<li>General income tax returns &#8211; three years from date of filing or two years from date of payment, whichever is longer</li>
<li>Employment tax records &#8211; four years after tax is due or paid, whichever is later</li>
<li>Deduction for bad debts or worthless securities &#8211; seven years</li>
<li>Business assets &#8211; until period of limitations expires after disposal of the property</li>
<li>Business ledgers, annual reports and similar documents &#8211; indefinitely</li>
<li>Invoices, accounts payable, expense reports &#8211; seven years</li>
<li>Cancelled checks &#8211; seven years</li>
<li>Bank account and credit card statements &#8211; seven years for annual statements, one year for monthly statements</li>
<li>Documents for potential or ongoing litigation &#8211; consult your company’s attorney(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Human resources files are among the most important for every business besides solo proprietorships. The recommended retention rate varies according to the type of file involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee files &#8211; seven years after resignation or termination</li>
<li>Files for job applicants not hired &#8211; three years minimum</li>
<li>Workers compensation files &#8211; four years after case conclusion</li>
<li>Benefit, pension, profit sharing records &#8211; indefinitely</li>
</ul>
<h3>Organization as a Sales and Marketing Tool</h3>
<p>It should be apparent that there is significant intrinsic value for your company to get organized and stay organized. However, organization can be both a sales tool and a marketing tool for your company as well. The key is to communicate the value for money benefits provided to your customers due to your company’s efficient and effective organization. An annual email or blog post allows you to outline specific achievements <span class="fr-style">—</span> such as rapid response time to customer requests <span class="fr-style">—</span> that remind your customers of why you deserve their business.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With only four months left in the year, many business owners are looking for ways to finish strong to make sure they end the year on the profitable side of the balance sheet. Over the course of the nearly 40 years of my career, I’ve learned that Benjamin Franklin was right, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” In other words, there are profits to be captured by making your business work more efficiently—or you might be able to consider the idea that efficiency is strength.</p>
<p>As a leader, finding ways to streamline processes, remove roadblocks, and facilitate your employee’s abilities to do their jobs makes them more efficient; and your business more profitable.</p>
<p>For example, early in my career I worked in my father’s industrial supply business. He sold bolts, nuts, and other hardware to manufacturers and industrial construction companies. On an almost daily basis, we would often cut bar stock to size for our customers, sometimes several hundred cuts at a time. In the early days, we used an abrasive wheel and a chop saw (a time-consuming and dirty job). It wasn’t very efficient and nobody liked the job, so we all avoided it as much as we could—which wasn’t very productive.</p>
<p>Although the chop saw seemed like a cheap way to get the job done, the day we bought a large band saw we could adjust to cut the material to the right size and automatically feed the stock to be cut, was a day for celebration. Now, instead of standing at the chop saw, we could start the job, the saw would feed the stock to the proper size, and all we had to do was keep it filled with material to cut. Not only that, we didn’t have to breath the dust from the abrasive wheel, we stopped avoiding those jobs, and we could do other things while the band saw did its job. It made things a lot more efficient.</p>
<p>The band saw made things so much easier, it was hard to imagine why we went so long with the old chop saw.</p>
<h3><strong>Big Results Through Small and Incremental Efficiency Efforts</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time, it doesn’t require, what we felt like was a big change, (like the band saw) to generate efficiencies that have a big impact. Most of the time, small, incremental, and sometimes very minor efforts can yield very big results.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m a big proponent of in-service training programs that leverage employee’s experiences and expertise that can help everyone be more efficient. In my current role, I spend a lot of time behind a personal computer; something that didn’t even exist when I started my career. This kind of sounds ridiculous as I write it, but I remember how difficult it was to learn how to use something as simple as a program like Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint when they first came out—now I don’t think I could do my job without them.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve learned numerous shortcuts that make me much more efficient in how I use the software. Some of those shortcuts I figured out on my own (a very inefficient way to do it), but most were shared with me by people who already knew. My more experienced colleagues were a great source of information that helped me be better at whatever my job was at the time. And, because we were sharing information, I had noticed and picked up a skill or two that benefitted them.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are three things, that might appear small and insignificant, that you can do to help your employees be more efficient, your business more profitable, and end your year strong:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #83eece;">
			<ol><li><strong>Look at your office, your shop, or your workspace:</strong> Sometimes something as simple as changing the way desks fit together, or the way tool boxes are situated, or the way the work space is generally set up can make a difference. For example, we had everything we needed to weigh, count, measure, and box materials for shipment all in the same place and all together so preparing an order for shipment was easier. This part of the warehouse was also near the door, so it was easier to get it on the truck when it came to pick up. What can you do in your business to make the workspace more efficient?</li><li><strong>Make sure your employees have the right tools: </strong>I admit I am somewhat of a tool nerd. I’ve found, as an amateur and self-taught motorcycle mechanic, that having the right tool for the job makes it a lot easier and faster to get the job done. Do your employees have the tools they need to be efficient? It could be something as simple as a more robust Internet connection if your business is online or a well-stocked closet of office supplies—or maybe even that specialty tool for compressing the spring on a motorcycle clutch.</li><li><strong>Do you encourage and reward employees for finding ways to improve what they’re doing?</strong> I’m convinced that those closest to the work tend to understand it the best. As a result, during the course of the day they often notice things that would make their jobs easier and more efficient. If you have an employee or two who have the same suggestion, it could be worth considering make a change (if needed). What’s more, offering a reward to employees who bring forward ideas that can help your business be more efficient and profitable—or even stronger, is an even better idea.</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>Looking over the list, these are things you may have even heard before, but in the spirit of small things that can have a big potential impact, don’t ignore them because you’ve heard them before. See if there are ways to make small and incremental improvements in how you do business that will make your business more efficient and more profitable.</p>
