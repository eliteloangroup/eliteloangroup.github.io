<h3><strong>1. Be in Good Standing with your Secretary of State</strong></h3>
<p>Businesses must file an annual report with the Secretary of State’s Office. This proves that your business met compliance requirements and may conduct business in the state. When your filing is in order and you’ve paid all required fees, your business is “active” and in Good Standing. To check your entity status,  visit your Secretary of State’s website to access its online report filing system. This is especially important if you’ve undergone changes to the corporation or LLC/LLP, business address, or DBA name.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Review your OnDeck payment history</strong></h3>
<p>Making on-time payments are a positive reflection of your credit profile. Too many missed payments can impact your renewal eligibility, so it’s important that you are up to date when you apply. Given that business owners may use several bank accounts at a time, it’s a good idea to track or set up alerts for your bank account on file with OnDeck. You may want to keep in contact with <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/support">OnDeck’s Payment Support team</a>, if needed.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Evaluate changes in your cash flow</strong></h3>
<p>Lenders want to understand your business’s cash flow and sales patterns – and so should you. Your current cash flow may differ from when you last applied, so carefully consider the timing of your next application. Keep in mind that OnDeck looks for at least 5 deposits to your bank account per month; for 3 months of bank statements, this means at least 15 deposits.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Monitor your business credit</strong></h3>
<p>OnDeck reports your on-time payments to major credit bureaus to help you build up a business credit profile. Good business credit shows lenders you are a credit-worthy customer. This distinction may increase your financing options in the future. You can check out your business credit profile with a service like our partner, <a href="https://app.nav.com/registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nav</a>.  OnDeck’s <a href="mailto:creditadvisor@ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Credit Advisors</a> can also provide you with one-on-one advice regarding business credit, Secretary of State, and general business questions.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Keep tax filings handy </strong></h3>
<p>Tax returns and extensions allows OnDeck to verify information like ownership percentage, financials, and Secretary of State. To speed up the application process, it’s helpful to keep a copy of your most recent return accessible.</p>
