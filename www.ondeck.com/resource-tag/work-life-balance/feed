								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans are notorious about leaving vacation days on the table. According to a 2018 article posted on the CNBC web portal, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/3-reasons-americans-wont-take-a-vacation-this-summer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of 1,000 survey respondents</a> polled by Bankrate did not plan to take a summer vacation. While half of those respondents cited lack of money, 22 percent claimed they could not take time off from work. It’s true that after returning from a relaxing vacation, returning to a high-stress work environment and a mountain of work can be a shock to the system. You may even feel like you need another vacation to recover.</p>
<p>If taking additional time off isn’t viable, that doesn’t leave you without options. The five strategies listed below can protect your mental health during the transition from vacation mode to the everyday work routine and beat the post-vacation blues.</p>
<h3><strong>Ease Back into the Routine</strong></h3>
<p>It’s unrealistic to expect to hit the ground running immediately after returning from a vacation. Instead, ease back into the routine while paving the way toward getting back into gear. If possible, come in a day before your planned return to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/harmoncullinan/2017/06/29/three-strategies-to-avoid-the-post-vacation-blues/#3d520edd1948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort through unread emails</a> and written materials. Divide them into two categories: “To Do” and “To Wait” so that you’ll know what to address first once you make your official return to work.</p>
<p>Refrain from overfilling your work calendar for the first few days after coming back. Especially avoid the temptation of jumping into a series of meetings right away. Instead, block off time in your calendar to meet individually with key colleagues — especially those who have covered for you while you were away. You should also set aside time to return phone calls, respond to emails and correspondence in your “To Do” category and catch up on other urgent matters.</p>
<h3><strong>Take Breaks Throughout the Day</strong></h3>
<p>One of the purposes of a vacation is to relax, distress and recharge. It’s natural that your mind will still be in vacation mode when you first return to work. Rather than dismiss this mindset, utilize it during scheduled meditation breaks throughout the day. According to an article in Psychology Today, imagining yourself in a location where you experienced enjoyment yields <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-tapas/201003/post-vacation-blues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beneficial neurological effects</a>.</p>
<p>Meditation does not have to be elaborate. You don’t have to sit cross-legged on your office floor and chant if you would feel awkward doing so. It’s sufficient to lean back in your chair and close your eyes for a few moments. If possible, leave your work area entirely and step outside for sunshine and fresh air.</p>
<p>Your colleagues may be curious about your vacation, and you may have dozens, if not hundreds of great photos and memories. Why not share a few with your colleagues — perhaps at lunch or briefly before scheduled meetings. Unless you and your coworkers are completely under the gun, this is a great way to extend the enjoyment of your vacation for a few days longer.</p>
<h3><strong>Anticipate Future Time Off</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you love what you do, taking breaks is essential. One way of ensuring that vacations are a viable option is by planning ahead. According to “The State of American Vacation 2017,” a report produced by Project Time Off, <a href="https://projecttimeoff.com/reports/the-state-of-american-vacation-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">52 percent of workers</a> who actively plan their vacations actually wind up taking all their allotted time off — versus just 40 percent of non-planners.</p>
<p>The first days of returning from your vacation represent an ideal time to plan your next period of time off from work. Even if you can’t pull off another full-fledged getaway right away, the anticipation of a long weekend a few weeks or months down the road can be enough to get you through those long, tedious meetings or endless piles of paperwork. You’ll be amazed by the benefits to your mental health.</p>
<h3><strong>Incorporate Your Vacation into Everyday Existence</strong></h3>
<p>Post-vacation letdown can give you a case of the blues. Especially if your time off was spent in an exciting or exotic location, your everyday existence can seem humdrum in comparison. Why not incorporate some of the aspects of your vacation into your regular routine? If you enjoyed eating delicious foods from another cuisine, include some of those items on your next grocery trip. These days, many grocery stores include extensive ethnic food sections. You may even have specialty stores in your location. Other commodities, such as clothing, writing papers, magazines and music can add a touch of vacation variety into your everyday life.</p>
<h3><strong>Recharge with Family and Friends</strong></h3>
<p>Numerous research studies have shown that prolonged isolation tends to feed depression. While you may be too busy at work to resume a regular social calendar right away after returning from vacation, avoid the tendency to get bogged down with work for weeks and months after your return. Instead, surround yourself with family and friends by scheduling fun activities or simply to decompress from the pressures of your work.</p>
<p>Your budget may be stretched thin after taking time off. Nonetheless, it’s important to make plans for fun during evenings or regular weekends, such as get-togethers with friends. Nothing elaborate or costly is necessary — a potluck dinner or an evening watching a DVD is an inexpensive way to reconnect with the important people in your life.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Back!</strong></h3>
<p>Planning for the time after your return from vacation can avoid the pitfalls of the post-vacation blues. Doing so can help preserve the benefits of rest, relocation and time away from work, and help you be more productive once you return.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the holiday season comes to a close, it’s normal to feel a little burnt out. No matter which industry you’re in, it can seem like a mad dash to the end of the year. For business owners, there’s more than enough on your plate with your regular day-to-day tasks and </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/have-this-year-be-your-best-year-ever"><span style="font-weight: 400">planning for the coming year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are 3 ideas to help you wind down after the holiday season ends:</span></h3>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Catch up with friends and family:</strong> No one close to a business owner is immune from the time commitment necessary to run a business. Take a few hours and catch up with friends and family. Make sure to let them know you appreciate them and their support.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Take a day to yourself:</strong> As a business owner you’re often giving your time to your business, your employees, and you give the leftovers to your family. Take a day and do what you want to do (with or without other people) go to a movie, go for a hike, get a massage, workout, or just plain do nothing. Leave work and the pressures of the year to come at the door for a day, and you’ll be surprised how good you’ll feel. </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Make a list of the “fun” things you want to do in the next year:</strong> As the wife of a small business owner, I find that if we write something down, it’s more likely to happen. We keep a list of fun activities we’d like to do together and somehow as the year ticks by we cross things off. (Pro tip: hang the list in a visible spot.)</span></li></ol>		</div>

			<p>Goal Setting for Small Business is a big deal. Understanding where you are and where you want to go sets up your business for short- and long-term success. In this article we'll go over 5 points to keep in mind when setting your goals for the future.</p><ol><li class="p1">Lack of Goals and Hindered Growth</li><li class="p1">Creating Work-Life Balance</li><li class="p1">Setting Attainable Goals</li><li class="p1">Prioritizing Goals</li><li class="p1">The Trap of Goal Setting</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>Founding Father Ben Franklin has been credited with the statement “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!” The truth of this statement is especially evident in relation to goal setting for small businesses. However, it&#8217;s also important to set attainable goals to ensure that they become <em>actual</em> achievements. It is equally important to understand when and how to prioritize goals when it’s impossible to accomplish everything right away.</p>
<h3>Lack of Goals and Hindered Growth</h3>
<p>The human brain is wired to solve challenges and work through obstacles. Tangible goals allow the brain to work at its optimal capacity, and achieving goals provides a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Likewise, employees perform better when they understand what is expected of them. Goals provide concrete direction for employees to pursue.</p>
<p>By contrast, an absence of goals often translates to a lack of direction, even in the most passionate entrepreneurs. There may be a flurry of activity, but not much actually gets accomplished. Employees may become frustrated because they don’t know what management wants <span class="fr-style">—</span> or they get the impression that their efforts don’t meet some unstated standard.</p>
<h3>Creating Work-Life Balance</h3>
<p>Especially when a business or entrepreneurial venture is in launch phase, goals often focus on profit and material gain. That’s understandable, and it can be satisfying to finally be able to make payroll or be able to meet all of your company’s invoices for the month if you’ve been struggling to cover start-up costs, or worse, you’ve been hit with an unexpected expense that threatens to blow up your entire enterprise. However, focusing only on money and profit-related goals often leads to burnout and ultimate failure.</p>
<p>Instead, strive to set a balance between work-related goals and the other areas of life, including family, friends, partners and enjoyable hobbies or pastimes. The optimal work-life balance varies from person to person and may even change over time. That’s OK. What’s important is that the goals you set for your work and your life are fulfilling and satisfying for you.</p>
<h3>Setting Attainable Goals</h3>
<p>There is much to be said in favor of aiming high in setting goals for your business or entrepreneurial enterprise. In their book <em>Built to Last</em>, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras wrote about the merits of setting “Big, Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAG)”. Setting such aspirational goals often inspires extraordinary achievement. One such BHAG was stated by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 when he challenged America to aspire to sending astronauts to the moon and returning them safely to Earth before the end of the decade. Although he did not live to see it, his BHAG became a reality when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon on July 20, 1969 <span class="fr-style">—</span> and his capsule indeed returned safely to Earth.</p>
<p>However, there is a danger in setting unattainable goals. One risk is burnout. Another hazard is the risk that frustration will set in and eventually lead to lethargy. Instead, business goals should strive to be viable and SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely. (Not to be confused with OnDeck&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/looking-small-business-loan-look-transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMART Box</a>)</p>
<p>The best goals are specific, realistic and potentially achievable. It’s not enough to say “I want my business to turn a profit.” Instead, set an attainable goal, such as “I want to increase my company’s revenues by X percent by midyear,” where X is a realistically attainable figure based on past performance and the capacity of your company and its resources.</p>
<p>You should also provide some tangible measure to determine whether your efforts are effective. For instance, a measurable goal would be to strive for a year-on-year increase in revenues from the first quarter of the previous year to the first quarter of the present year.</p>
<p>Finally, goals should be timely. Set a reasonable time frame for achieving your ultimate goal. For many goals, one year is a reasonable time frame. However, it’s also wise to set incremental time frames, for instance, quarterly or monthly. Determine what reasonable progress toward the ultimate goal would look like at each incremental time frame. Doing so serves two purposes. First, it’s easier to remain on track and second, viewing progress at interval goals provides tangible evidence that progress is indeed being made, which reduces frustration.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Goals</h3>
<p>In many small businesses, everyone is expected to wear multiple hats. There is often an “all hands on deck” atmosphere that can be exhilarating. However, when people are expected to pursue too many goals, the unfortunate outcome is that people become focused on “checking off” items on a goal list rather than actual accomplishments.</p>
<p>A smarter course of action is to acknowledge that, while it may be desirable to achieve every goal, it is often unrealistic to expect that they can or should be pursued at once. Instead, it’s essential to prioritize certain goals for immediate attention while scheduling others for a later date. Do not confuse prioritizing goals with procrastination, which often occurs as a result of feeling overwhelmed by the impossibility of accomplishing all of a specific set of goals.</p>
<h3>The Trap of Goal Setting</h3>
<p>As essential as the process of goal setting is, it’s important to remember that setting goals is not a magic bullet. Otherwise, the danger exists that goal setting becomes an end unto itself. Even the most worthwhile goals represent just the beginning of the process <span class="fr-style">—</span> execution is still necessary in realizing those goals.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you love them, hate them (or regard them with complete indifference), holiday celebrations are an undeniable reality of many company cultures. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas — when the silly season hits, work life can seem like a relentless parade of tinsel, paper plates and sensibly casual slacks.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, why do we do it? Do these celebrations serve a deeper purpose? Or are they best simply gotten rid of when the company budget gets tight? Most importantly, if we do keep the holiday traditions, how do you get the best bang for your buck on a limited budget?</p>
<p>Here’s our take on these holiday imponderables.</p>
<h3>Why Have Holiday Celebrations at All?</h3>
<p>It’s a fair question. Let’s face it, while there are going to be <em>some</em> people in any company who live for the next corporate shin-dig, a lot of people regard these events with something approaching disdain. The fact is, arguments about opportunity cost and corporate austerity aside, holiday celebrations are just a very human thing to do.</p>
<p>Sure people might gripe about it, but it brings people together. They provide an opportunity for colleagues to step away from the daily grind and just … hang out as people. It’s an emotional rationale sure, but there’s nothing wrong with celebrating the fact that we aren’t just faceless work droids from time to time.</p>
<p>Setting the feely, touchy stuff aside though, there’s also a very tangible reason holiday celebrations are a good thing. They reinforce loyalty and cohesion and they improve engagement.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup analysis</a> of workplace productivity found that companies with a highly motivated and engaged workforce outperformed rival companies by 147 percent in earnings. Flipping that coin, <a href="https://risepeople.com/blog/employee-engagement-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the estimated cost</a> of a disengaged workforce is between $450 and $550 billion, annually.</p>
<p>Are holiday celebrations the magical ingredient which makes engagement happen? Well, no. However, they are definitely one small part of what keeps people together and motivated to be part of a greater whole.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>holiday celebrations are important, even if you’re on a tight budget.</p>
<h3>Holiday Celebrations on a Budget</h3>
<p>So, if you buy the argument that we shouldn’t dispense with them altogether, how can we make holiday celebrations worthwhile when money is a limiting factor?</p>
<p>The key here is to keep the company eye on the collective prize. Building loyalty and engagement is the goal here &#8211; <em>not </em>opulence or (brace yourself) “optics”.</p>
<p>Here’s three ways to make that happen.</p>
<h4>1. Reinforce a Sense of Kinship</h4>
<p>A holiday celebration is an opportunity to recognize the <em>human</em> experience of working within the company. This needn’t and shouldn’t be heavy handed.</p>
<p>It can be as simple as managers mingling not with a view to “networking” and instead opening up conversations about highs and lows. What was fun these last few months, and what … well … sucked.</p>
<p>On a slightly more nuts and bolts level, getting all staff (rather than the dreaded party committee) involved in decorations and music can be a great way to build a sense of kinship while simultaneously saving costs on DJs and catering. Win win!</p>
<h4>2. Get People Talking</h4>
<p>Making a holiday hootenanny an opportunity for everyone to speak and be part of a conversation also reinforces the idea that we’re all in this together. Again, this needn’t be organized or choreographed. In fact, only the most die hard of extroverts among us likes big group “ice-breakers”. Most introverts hate them.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t find structured low-key opportunities to get people talking. Tables could be set up with trivia or other questions, for example. The room can be set up in a way which encourages different sets of people talking. Managers could even try to introduce people who might not normally talk to one another.</p>
<p>None of this costs money. It just requires encouraging folks to open up.</p>
<h4>3. Be Inclusive</h4>
<p>To build loyalty, it isn’t necessary to wow people with lavish options. But you do need to show that you’ve listened to their preferences. Being sure to give participants the opportunity to express their tastes, dietary restrictions, and family requirements is a big step toward showing them they’re genuinely welcome and valued. In fact, it’ll likely go a lot further than fancy appetizers and drinks with umbrellas.</p>
<p>Getting the best bang for your buck from a holiday celebration may be as simple as spending a bit of time up-front identifying what people <em>actually</em> want, rather than pulling the trigger on a fancy caterer or opulent event location.</p>
<h3>A Few Things to Avoid</h3>
<p>It’s probably worth mentioning a few things to avoid if you’re trying to create a fun and inclusive holiday celebration on a budget.</p>
<h4>1. Avoid Lots of Alcohol</h4>
<p>Most would agree a bit of drinky goodness is fine, but a lot is a) expensive and b) unlikely to produce a memorable experience. Instead of using alcohol as a social lubricant, focus instead on creating a fun and relaxing environment. Good music and good food go a long way!</p>
<h4>2. Don’t Make It Too Formal</h4>
<p>If you do have seating arrangements, find an opportunity to mix it up. Generally, we tribal humans have a tendency to stick within our own cliques. The more formal and structured the party, the more likely that is to happen.</p>
<p>Comfortable, open seating is way better. Make the chairs movable! The more movement and informality you can introduce the greater the likelihood the party will have a life of its own rather than be a stifled, corporate affair.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the cheaper the venue the more likely this is to happen. Lavish party venues tend to breed an air of everyone having to be respectful of the layout. A cheaper party venue or casual home environment reinforces the idea that you can relax and enjoy yourself.</p>
<h3>Try Not To Make It About Work</h3>
<p>This is a tough one! Sure, it’s a work function, but people have plenty of time to talk about work during office hours! It’s a good idea to keep the party a work-announcement free zone.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of a corporate holiday celebration on a limited budget may require a little extra versatility to organize. However, it’s also a great opportunity to focus on what counts.</p>
<p>After all, loyalty and engagement aren’t bought with fancy catering! They’re a result of listening, inclusion and showing that we’re all in this together. And all that good stuff is 100% free.</p>
<p>Happy Celebrating!</p>

<p>Like many business owners, it&#8217;s likely you are constantly seeking ways to save money on operating expenses, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/create-plan-managing-employee-expenses-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including payroll</a>. One area where many employers target is paid time off. It is a truism that providing paid time off, especially paid sick leave, is costly. While this may be an understandable approach, denying paid sick leave for your workers is a penny wise, but pound foolish policy that will likely cost your business money in the end. What&#8217;s more, providing paid sick leave for your workers benefits your company’s bottom line in ways you might not realize.</p>
<h3>Less Absenteeism</h3>
<p>The flu season of 2017 and 2018 was one of the worst in recent history. A particularly severe strain of the flu (H3N2) reduced the effectiveness of the flu vaccine; that and widespread infection (46 states as of January 2018) combined to create nearly a perfect storm. Another factor that almost certainly made matters worse was a unavailability of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 28 percent of all civilian workers — approximately 45 million Americans — do not have access to paid sick leave. If they take time off from work, their paychecks suffer. They may even risk losing their jobs. The result is a phenomenon known as “presenteeism” — people reporting for work who should be home in bed, or even in the hospital. It is a widespread occurrence. According to a July 2016 report co-produced by NPR, The Robert Wood Foundation and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, every week 1.5 million Americans who do not have paid sick leave go to work when they are sick.</p>
<p>In a confined environment like an office, a single sick employee can infect an entire staff, with some becoming so ill that they cannot come to work. Multiply this occurrence by thousands of sick people riding public transportation, interacting in public places and working in food-handling or health care environments. It doesn’t take much effort to comprehend how an epidemic can reach potentially debilitating proportions. On the other hand, providing paid sick leave — and encouraging workers to use it — not only allows sick workers to recuperate, it also reduces the risk of your other employees missing time due to illness.</p>
<h3>Better Morale</h3>
<p>Many employers resist efforts to raise minimum wages and impose paid sick leave, but often change their minds once such policies have been put in place. The reason is simple: their fears of employee abuse and escalating costs have largely proven to be unfounded. For example, San Francisco has mandated paid sick leave since 2007. However, the median worker only takes 3 of 5 allowed sick days each year, and 6 out of 7 employers reported no significant detrimental effect on profitability.</p>
<p>At the same time, morale among workers increases significantly in workplaces with employee friendly policies such as paid sick leave. About 30 percent of employers in Connecticut reported improved morale among their employees as a result of the passage of a paid sick leave law.</p>
<h3>Reduced Employee Turnover</h3>
<p>At the height of the Great Recession, there were more than 6 applicants for every job opening. In that environment, employers felt free to demand more productivity from their employees while holding down wages and cutting back on perks like paid sick leave.</p>
<p>However, by 2013 the ratio had fallen to 2.9 job seekers to every opening and has continued to fall. In the resulting tight labor market, employees are naturally more likely to seek better working conditions, and employers have begun to respond accordingly, including those in the traditionally low-paid service sector. For instance, in January 2018, Starbucks announced that it would provide paid sick leave for all its salaried and hourly employees in the interests of improving working conditions and reducing employee turnover.</p>
<h3>Increased Productivity</h3>
<p>Sick workers are less productive than healthy workers. It may seem obvious, but many employers fail to realize the financial benefit they stand to gain from adopting a paid sick leave policy. According to a study cited by the New York Times, lower productivity from sick workers on the job costs employers as much as their medical care. In other words, employers aren’t saving any money by encouraging (or demanding) their workers to report to work when they’re sick. On the other hand, providing paid sick leave for your workers not only means less “presenteeism” but also allows workers to address acute conditions such as dental problems while they are relatively minor.</p>
<h3>Lower Risk to Your Customers or Clients</h3>
<p>Companies with employees in public-facing jobs or businesses affiliated with the medical or food industries especially stand to benefit from providing their workers paid sick leave. Workers in these situations who feel compelled to come to work while they are sick may spread infectious diseases that are not only detrimental to their colleagues but also place the general public at risk.</p>
<p>Providing paid sick leave is not just a “nice” benefit for employers to provide for their workers. It’s also smart business policy. Morale, productivity and the bottom line all benefit when workers are allowed to stay home when they are not feeling well, without risking their jobs.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separation between work and home lives is a myth for most small business owners. (You’re likely living proof of this constant battle.) Time is your most valuable possession and the holiday season makes the overwhelming demand of your time much more noticeable to you and to your family members. For many business owners, the holiday season can be your busiest time, while with other businesses it can be slower. Either way, you’re working hard to finish out the year on top and preparing your business for a strong year to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balancing this critical time of year for your business and with your family needs can be tricky. It’s easy for either your family or your business to feel neglected. It doesn’t need to be that way. I know there are a ton of time management articles out there (we’ve even written </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/time-management-101-ebook-take-back-your-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/3-unexpected-ways-business-owners-are-wasting-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but this is not a time management how-to. These are ideas and suggestions how you can keep your business running full steam ahead, while having meaningful time with your friends and family.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>At The Office</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping spirits high at the office is essential. It’s easy to get sluggish at the end of the year since everyone is focusing on family and the upcoming holidays. The end of the year is also a crucial time for any business. You want to be able to finish the year strong, and at the same time make sure that you’re not running yourself and your employees ragged. </span></p>
<p><strong>Here are some non-bank breaking ideas to keep distraction down and momentum up.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Give your employees a break:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Scheduling in some fun time throughout the upcoming weeks is a great way to keep everyone focused without seeming like a drill sergeant. As the boss, create a holiday-themed break for your employees. Have a bake-off, pick a date for everyone to sit down and have lunch together, do a white elephant or secret Santa. You don’t need to do all of these activities nor do they need to happen daily. These events will send the message that there is a designated time to play. Then you can all get back to work and make it happen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Show appreciation:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Very few things will make an employee feel appreciated by some type of bonus or company gift. You don’t need to go all out, but a little something shows you care and goes a long, long way to keep spirits high.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Run a contest:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nothing gets my blood pumping like a good contest. (I’m not afraid to admit I may be a little too competitive at times) Be it hitting a company related target or a light-hearted dance-off; it’s a way to bring your employees together for a fun treat.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Simplify the holiday party:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depending on the size of your company a holiday party could look very different. I’ve experienced a small party in the office, dinner at a restaurant, karaoke night (OnDeck’s favorite go-to activity). Many small businesses can’t afford to go all out for a holiday party, but don’t let that stop you from making one. Keep it casual, during the day, and keep it employees only. Doing something special for your company gives you and your employees a break from the norm. It can be just the thing to reinvigorate you and your employees for the rest of the year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Offer some time off:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all businesses are crazy busy during the holiday season. If that applies to you, give your employees some time back. Make Friday a half day, or let your best employees work from home one day. It won’t cost you a ton and it will mean a lot to have extra time to go gift shopping and prepare for the holidays with their families.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Give back:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get everyone into the holiday spirit and organize a way for you and your employees to give back. Maybe that’s volunteering together, organizing a food/coat/toy drive, or collecting donations to your favorite charity. This could also connect back to #3 and turn it into a contest with some prizes.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3><span style="color: #ff474a;"><b>At Home</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping your family happy during the holidays is not that much different than keeping your employees happy. You will have to use different tactics to get you to the same place. Show your family you care by giving more of yourself.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Designate time:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have a significant other, kids, or living alone, giving time to your family is the most precious gift you can give this holiday season. All year your family supports you and your business and a big part of that is knowing sacrificing the time we get to spend with you. Designate 30 minutes every day to forgetting about your business and giving that time to your family. Spend more time with your kids, spouse, or simply call your parents, siblings, and grandparents. This small amount of time won’t negatively affect your business, and it will get majorly noticed by your loved ones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Put your phone down:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Out for drinks, having dinner, even having a conversation with involved the likelihood you’ll be interrupted by work. All year your family and friends put up with your phone in your hand 24/7 because we are your business’ biggest supporters. Give us a small break these next few weeks and put your phone down. (or at least turn it over)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Actually wrap your own gifts:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am excellent at gift wrapping. It’s one of the few areas I truly shine during the holiday season.  (I even took a class) I come from a big, close-knit family full of business owners, (my grandfather, my cousin, my aunt, my brother-in-law, and my husband.) nothing shows that you took time out of your day more than wrapping your own gifts. I know that my husband’s wrapping job won’t have perfect, handmade bows and multiple twists and folds in the paper, but I know he took the time to wrap it himself.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Plan a holiday movie marathon:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Plan a night to watch your favorite holiday movies. Get the popcorn, the candy, the whole nine yards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Build a gingerbread house:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don’t have little kids? Don’t fool yourself, everyone loves gingerbread houses! Even better, make it contest, see who can make the best one.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Bring the holiday cheer:</b></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you haven’t gotten the hint by now, your time and attention is the big theme throughout this section. Do something extra around the house, cook a dish for the big family dinner, do the laundry (we’ll love you forever), pick people up from the airport, anything you can think of to make the lives of your loved ones a little more cheerful.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I don’t know you, your business or your family, these are just a few ideas that don’t require too much effort, but can go a long way in making your family and your employees feel appreciated during the holiday season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tag pictures of you showing your love </span><span style="color: #0074ff;"><b>@ondeckcapital #holidaylove</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy Holidays!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<p><span style="color: #ffffff">Work/life balance is becoming more important to employees and  businesses have been working hard to beef up their benefits and perks. This can be a huge cost for small business owners, but don't worry! Here are some highly appealing benefits you can offer your employees without breaking the bank.</span></p>		</div>
		
<p>Employee perks have been a popular and important topic for business owners in recent years. With the rapid advancement of technology, employers have more options for the types of benefits they can offer employees. Instead of providing the same benefits that have been around for decades, such as health insurance, paid time off and sick days, you now need to consider extra perks that help you stand out from your competitors while keeping your budget and business needs in mind. Here are a few modern benefits that make sense and save you cents for your small business benefits package:</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Remote Work Opportunities</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">There are several pros and cons to letting your employees work remotely, but it can be a great benefit for your employees as well as your company. Some of the highly lauded pros are that remote work decreases absences, increases productivity and saves money. If employees come down with a cold, have a family emergency or are just feeling stressed in the office, they may take a sick day when it&#8217;s not really necessary. If you offer a work-from-home policy, your employees can work on their own time and deal with their work-life balance as they need to, meaning you still get your eight hours of work and your employees are happier.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">In terms of productivity, you should consider remote work on a case-by-case basis. Some employees work better in their chosen environment without the distraction of other employees, meetings, commuting and office politics. Simon Slade, CEO of Affilorama, tells Monster that job performance and satisfaction with his remote workers are about the same as his in-house employees, but he sees a <a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/the-benefits-of-working-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher rate of productivity</a>. However, some employees may find that their kids, chores and home setup doesn&#8217;t work for them. If your employees can concentrate better at home, this is a great benefit for both you and them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">One of the greatest beneficiaries of remote work is your company bank account. According to Global Workplace Analytics, about <a href="http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/resources/costs-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 percent of employers</a> say that cost savings are significant. You can save a lot of money on real estate and equipment for your office, even if your employees telecommute only part of the time. Alpine Access Remote Agents saw huge benefits to their finances by closing 30 percent more deals and decreasing customer complaints by 90 percent. In other words, giving your employees the option to work from home as a small business benefit could be a win for both of you.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Flexible Hours</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Offering flexible work hours has many of the same benefits as remote work. When employees feel like they have more control over their work and personal lives, they tend to be happier, healthier and more productive. As an employer, flex hours enable you to open up your talent pool to more people and compete with other companies for the best candidates. If you want to employ parents who need to drop their kids off at school at 7:45, allowing them to come into the office at 8:30 instead of 8:00 can make a big difference in their week. If you want to employ an individual who works better at night than in the morning, flex hours could boost their productivity. The more you help your employees decrease their stress and work to make them happier, the morale in your office will increase and so will your bottom line.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Offer Unlimited Time Off as Part of Your Small Business Benefits</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Unlimited time off has been making headlines for the last several years for both its pros and cons. Some argue that employees will take advantage of their PTO not being tracked, while others state that employees take less time off because they have to prove that they&#8217;re working harder than their co-workers. This has led to companies like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3052926/we-offered-unlimited-vacation-for-one-year-heres-what-we-learned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mammoth renaming this benefit</a> to &#8220;flexible,&#8221; &#8220;personalized&#8221; or &#8220;responsible&#8221; PTO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The key to this benefit is to make it work for your company&#8217;s workflow and culture. Unlimited time off shows your employees that you trust them to be responsible adults and that you value their work-life balance. When your employees have the chance to get away from the office to recharge and relax, they will come back refreshed and ready to work. Make sure your expectations and rules surrounding this policy are clear and that it doesn&#8217;t lead to all working vacations or abuse of the policy. If it works for your culture, you will be offering a competitive benefit that will lead to happier employees that stay with you longer.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px">Consider Winter Vacation for Small Business Benefits</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The end of the year is full of holidays, vacations and the scramble to take unused PTO days. Instead of trying to piece together your office, consider shutting down your office the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Day for a well-deserved break. Depending on your industry, a lot of your clients and customers will be busy with their families and the office will be pretty empty anyway, so why not treat your employees to some extra time off? In many industries, this is an expected part of the holiday season.</p>
<p>The modern small business benefits package isn&#8217;t all about a 401K or health insurance. As important as they are, they aren’t the only way to help your employees feel appreciated. When your employees feel appreciated and trusted, they will work harder for you. The happier they are, the happier you (and your bank account) will be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff">The Ultimate Work/Life Balance Goal: Your Employee and Employer Guide to the Remote Workforce.</span></h1>
<p>Telecommuting and the remote workforce has been growing since technology has begun to transform our lives.  Along with transformations in technology, we’ve seen an adoption of the remote workforce by mainstream employers with a mountain of stats and information that backup the support for telecommuting.  Employee satisfaction, and increased productivity are credited as the largest benefits, the work from home crowd is definitely shifting how we think about going to work.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #ff474a"><strong><a style="color: #ff474a;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.ondeckfinancing.com/remoteworkforce2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download the Full Color PDF Guide Here</a></strong></span></h2>
<p>That could explain why a greater number of U.S. workers now work from home than at any time in history (excluding, of course, any point in time before the Industrial Revolution, when everyone worked from home). Take a look at the growing trend, as shown by a recent <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/184649/telecommuting-work-climbs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a></span></span> poll:<br />

<p>Around the globe, telecommuting is even more popular. PGI&#8217;s <em>Global Telework Survey</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://go.pgi.com/gen-genspec-15telesur-SC1129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms</a></span> what we all suspect: a whoppingly high number of global workers (79 percent of knowledge workers, in fact) are telecommuters. What&#8217;s more, 60 percent of knowledge workers would drop their current gig in a flash if they could work from home full time.</p>

<p>For employees, the reasons for preferring to work from home boil down to a few simple benefits (simple yet overwhelmingly powerful, that is).</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>1. No More Road Rage, Crowded Subways, Traffic Jams&#8230;</strong></span></h3>
<p>The most obvious advantage of telecommuting is no more horrible commute to work.

<p><em>A Huge Percentage of Cars Would Disappear From Roads if Telecommuting Really Took Off</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>2. It&#8217;s Cheaper</strong></span></h3>
<p>According to the American Automobile Association&#8217;s fascinating annual <em>Your Driving Costs </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/auto/your-driving-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a></span>, the opportunity cost of commuting has decreased but it&#8217;s still shockingly high.</p>

<p><em>It costs a lot to commute to work, but that&#8217;s only one of the reasons people love telecommuting.</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>3. It Leaves More Time for Life Outside of Work</strong></span></h3>
<p>When we&#8217;re not spending an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://project.wnyc.org/commute-times-us/embed.html#5.00/42.000/-89.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of 25.4 minutes</a></span></span>  <em>each way </em>on our daily commute to work, there&#8217;s suddenly a whole lot more time in life for&#8230; <em>life. </em>You&#8217;ve heard of the life-work balance? Telecommuting is how you achieve that.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>4. More Time with Friends and Family</strong></span></h3>
<p>We all have friends at work, and enjoy the social gathering, but friends and family are high priority for most anyone.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff474a">More than half of all American families have both parents working.  Reducing the commute, and increasing the time at home saves time, money, and energy and allows more time at home with the family.</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164641"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164641" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=847%2C574&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="847" height="574" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=768%2C520&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are endless socio-political reasons that having a parent at home during childhood is beneficial. It’s good for families and it’s good for society. A 1998 <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1998)49:12%3C1115::AID-ASI7%3E3.0.CO;2-Y/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></span></span> found that workers with children rated the stress reduction of telecommuting higher than those without children. In other words, telecommuting means a <em>lot</em> to parents, as well as to their children of course.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Finally, there are a few economic reasons, too, namely that daycare expenses are chipping away at families&#8217; incomes like a hungry wolf might &#8220;chip away&#8221; at a shank of meat.</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5. You Can Take Care of Things While You Work</strong></span></h3>
<p>Got a leaky faucet? A sick dog? A bad cold? Traditional workers would have to choose whether to take care of life&#8217;s little curve balls or trudge in to work. Telecommuters can do both (without the trudging, of course).</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>6. Your Life is Less Stressful</strong></span></h3>
<p>Unless your home life is riddled with stress points and your job is your only salvation for sanity, working from home will reduce your stress levels significantly. Results from studies vary, but some <strong><em>report as high as 82% of remote workers say their stress levels are reduced because they don&#8217;t commute to work.</em></strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What&#8217;s in it For Employers, Though?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, telecommuting has been linked to an actual increase in productivity.</p>
<p>Stanford University Professor of Economics Nicholas Bloom conducted a huge <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://people.stanford.edu/nbloom/sites/default/files/wfh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telecommuting study</a></span></span> in 2011 and found three very important advantages for employers who chose a remote workforce. We’ll show you even more after telling you about his big three.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>1. Save Space and Overhead</strong></span></h3>
<p>With fewer workers, you have lower overhead costs (slash your pencil budget!). Save on supplies, utilities, and even rent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://remote.co/10-stats-about-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aetna</a></span></span> has anywhere from 14,500 to 35,000 remote workers, allowing them to forgo 2.7 million square feet of office space. The savings? An impressive $78 million! American Express did the same and their savings topped $15 million <em>annually.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco</a></span> started allowing telecommuting and as a result saved $277 million a year. And think of the money you&#8217;ll save in transportation reimbursement.</p>
<p>Plus, since remote employees tend to be more productive and stay longer at their jobs (see the next two reasons), you will save money due to those factors, too. Telework Coalition <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/3-reasons-you-should-let-your-employees-work-remotely-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a></span></span> that the average business saves around $20,000 per year for each individual full-time worker!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>2. Increase Employee Retention</strong></span></h3>
<p>Bloom found that telecommuters were happier with their jobs, and therefore less likely to quit. For employers, that&#8217;s less turnover, which means less time spent training new hires. <em>Cha-ching.</em></p>
<p>A National Institutes of Health <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></span></span> found that telecommuters had higher job satisfaction, better performance, less stress, and as a result, fewer quit their jobs. In fact, some benefits of telecommuting increased as time spent working from home increased. These included such factors as better performance evaluations.</p>
<p>Relationships with co-workers, however, did not improve when telecommuting rates went higher. Nevertheless, the overall effect of allowing workers to work from home seems to be, in study after study, increased job satisfaction and less turnover.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>3. Increase Productivity</strong></span></h3>
<p>Back to Professor Bloom&#8217;s study, which was actually conducted on his own company, a customer service operation in Shanghai. Telecommuters (workers who worked four days from home and one day in the office) were able to handle 15 percent more calls. Overall, they were four percent more productive than their colleagues back  in the office.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the telecommuters also worked 11 percent more hours than their colleagues who slogged into the call center every morning.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Why might this be? Bloom&#8217;s telecommuters:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>took fewer sick days</li>
<li>exercised more</li>
<li>smoked less</li>
<li>took fewer breaks</li>
<li>weren&#8217;t ever late because of commuting issues</li>
<li>were less likely to quit their jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s another case in point: <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automattic</a></span></span>. They are 100% &#8220;distributed&#8221;, which is an insider&#8217;s term for a company with a remote workforce. They run WordPress, one the most-visited websites in the world. Absolutely <em>everyone</em> who works for Automattic does so from home/cafe/wherever&#8230; anyplace but an Automattic office, if there even is such a thing. They&#8217;re hugely successful, and here&#8217;s what their workforce looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164651"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164651" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=864%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="864" height="483" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=399%2C224&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>What a Remote Workforce Looks Like</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>4. Philanthropic Reasons for Telecommuting</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you care enough about the world outside your business to make changes accordingly, then telecommuting makes sense for several philanthropic reasons, too.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Telecommuting is green. </strong>Less commuting means less car driving, which means less pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting opens up opportunities for rural workers.</strong> Hey, you don&#8217;t have to move to New York any more to get the best jobs (or L.A. or San Francisco or Chicago&#8230;)</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting opens up opportunities for those with disabilities. </strong>For anyone with mobility challenges, being part of a remote workforce is a godsend.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a></span></span> published in 2009, Cisco reported that their teleworkers prevented over 47,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas from entering the environment. For the workers, that translated into over $10 million saved annually in fuel costs.</p>
<p>So, now you see how having allowances for a remote workforce becomes an act of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5. You Can Hire the Best, Even if They Don&#8217;t Live Nearby</strong></span></h3>
<p>Here is another reason for employers to love a remote workforce: you can now hire the best employee for the job. You may now expand your search to the outer limits of the earth, if you so desire, in search of the One Perfect Candidate.</p>
<p>No more worrying that you&#8217;ll have to lure someone from another part of the country (or the world, for that matter). You also won&#8217;t have to pay to have a telecommuter relocated. No moving expenses. And telecommuting also eliminates an even bigger worry when hiring from outside your immediate geographical area: all that money spent hiring relocating someone won&#8217;t be wasted if they turn out to be something less than desirable once you&#8217;ve got them there in the office.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>6. You Might Attract More Millennials</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of the majority of businesses interested in attracting, pleasing, and retaining Millennial workers, then offering them the option of working from home is a good move.</p>
<p>A survey by <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.aftercollege.com/cf/2015-annual-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AfterCollege</a></span></span> reveals what most of us know via intuition: over two-thirds of Millennial job seekers say that if an employer offers telecommuting options, they are suddenly way more interested in working for that company.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Challenges:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>What About the Notion of the Workplace as the Hub of Creativity?</strong></span></h3>
<p>Hallway chats are supposedly a trigger of creativity in the workplace.  Is that the reality?</p>
<p>The kind of spontaneous interaction that knits together an organization is what many employers fear will go away if they switch over to remote workforces. How will employees exchange ideas, brainstorm informally, bump into one another for impromptu conversations that lead to great things?</p>
<p>In his <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17396014-the-year-without-pants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a></span></span> <em>The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work</em>, Scott Berkun writes about all the wonderful ways WordPress (which is 100% distributed by the way) encourages creativity in its employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Berkun can report with authority because he actually went and applied for a job (and got one) at WordPress (run by afore-mentioned Automattic) so he could find out how a company that&#8217;s 100% distributed actually works.</p>
<p>He specifically cites that company&#8217;s use of internal blogs and chat rooms to promote collaboration.</p>
<p>Those and other types of in-person serendipitous encounters will undoubtedly change if you adopt a remote workforce, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be at the expense of creativity and productivity. Yes, telecommuting changes the nature of work-related interaction but it does not have to inhibit creativity.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s software for that.</p>
<p>That brings us to the next section of our guide to telecommuting: the tools used to keep everyone in touch and in line.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Solutions:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Tools Are Key</strong></span></h3>
<p>There are a number of fantastic and impressive ways to stay connected, be creative, and share ideas across the web these days, and to cover them all here would not do them all justice. But we&#8217;ll show you a few of the essential concepts to grasp in case you&#8217;re a total newbie to the whole world of telecommuting, cloud-based project management software, and other crucial inventions you may have missed along the way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start by erasing any misconceptions some of you may still have about the right and wrong way telecommuters stay in touch. If there&#8217;s one take-away to this &#8220;Tools&#8221; sections, it&#8217;s that you must move beyond email.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Email- Use Sparingly</strong></span></p>
<p>Email is NOT the telecommuter&#8217;s best friend. It may have been an essential component of the telecommuting dreamscape as imagined by mid-1990s tech geeks planning the remote workforce revolution of the future, but things have changed since then.</p>
<p>Basically, using email to communicate, share documents, and disseminate important information in 2016 is like commuting to work on an ox. It&#8217;s just so terribly clunky and slow, unmanageable an un-nimble that it&#8217;s downright painful to imagine anyone would choose such an outdated form of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">transportation </span>communication. You might as well just go into the office for all the inconvenience and antiquity of using email for doc sharing, organization, and communicating.  There are several great options for collaboration and communication software for the distributed remote workforce.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><em>If you use email to share documents, you might as well start commuting again. In an ox cart.</em></span></h3>
<p>Instead, today&#8217;s real telecommuters use a potent mix of Skype, internal blogs, social media, and chatrooms plus of course project management software to keep things humming along with their remote workforces. Here are a few of the most important tools you should know about.  Some favorites include Hipchat, Slack, Basecamp, and other similar software for a variety of necessary project management and communication tasks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Communicating</strong></span></p>
<p>Facetime, GoToMeeting, and Google Hangouts are great options for staying in touch with remote employees (there are tons more, but those are some of the most common). They&#8217;re all tools which can help managers connect with their teams in efficient ways that keep pathways of communication open. You see a face, you talk in real time, and it’s almost like being in the room with your employees.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Managing Tasks</strong></span></p>
<p>There are countless productivity software packages, many of them cloud-based. One is Asana, and there&#8217;s also BaseCamp, Teamwork, and more, offering the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>calendars</li>
<li>scheduling</li>
<li>Gantt charts</li>
<li>discussions</li>
<li>shareable notes</li>
<li>activity streams</li>
<li>file management</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>webinars, video tutorials, help articles, and user guides</li>
<li>mobile app</li>
<li>milestones</li>
<li>issue management</li>
<li>project pathways and due dates</li>
<li>project prioritization</li>
<li>project timelines</li>
<li>individual team member task lists</li>
<li>reporting</li>
<li>chatting</li>
<li>commenting</li>
<li>assigning tasks</li>
<li>notifications</li>
<li>email integration</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, project management software can be integrated with third-party software packages like Dropbox, Google Apps, Salesforce, and others.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What About Performance Metrics?</strong></span></h2>
<p>For employers, telecommuting employees’ means striking a balance between workers&#8217; autonomy and accountability. Managers can&#8217;t simply measure hours of butts in seats like they used to. They&#8217;re pretty much forced to look purely at productivity, or output.</p>
<p>That can in itself be a boon to efficiency and productivity&#8230; measure that!</p>
<p>One way to do that is using tools like Harvest, which allows for employee time tracking and individual goal-setting. Another component of a successful remote workforce is trust. Productivity is largely a product of motivation, so knowing how to keep your workers happy is one way to see to it that they&#8217;re doing their jobs at home.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>When Telecommuting Might Not Work: Weak Company Culture or Bad Times?</strong></span></h2>
<p>When a business is in trouble, telecommuting may not always be the best idea. At least that was the reasoning behind Yahoo’s Former CEO Marissa Mayer&#8217;s ban on telecommuting in 2013.</p>
<p>Her now-infamous ban was a desperate pitch to shore up morale, improve productivity, and keep the ranks together in the face of impending possible doom.</p>
<p>At the time of Mayer&#8217;s controversial ban, Yahoo was spiraling downwards fast. Part of her solution was to gather the ranks and hunker them down to work under the watchful eye of management. In a statement from Yahoo Human Resources at the time, the reasoning was explained this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff474a"><em>&#8220;To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo, and that starts with physically being together.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><em>-Jackie Reses, Yahoo&#8217;s human resources chief</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, if your company suffers from low morale, weak company culture, or bad management, allowing telecommuting may be a recipe for making a bad situation worse. That wouldn&#8217;t be the fault of telecommuting per se, but rather just more fallout from a bad company scene where dysfunction is just too pervasive to allow for optimal conditions for anything, much less allowing part of the workforce to remain at home for work.</p>
<p>Ms. Mayer may have been totally wrong about workers feeling connected at work, however. A Harvard <span style="color: #0074ff"><u><a style="color: #0074ff" href="https://hbr.org/2012/08/are-you-taking-your-people-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></u></span> found that a surprising 87 percent of workers who worked from home actually felt <em>more</em> connected. Their secret? Video conferencing. They may have also benefited from the fact they weren&#8217;t working for a company that was spiraling down the drain faster than you could say &#8220;Yahoo&#8221;.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Recap</strong></span></h2>
<p>It seems the likelihood of offering your work force the ability to work from home at least part of the week can benefit everyone involved. For all the misgivings about remote workforces, it even seems they work harder to communicate, be productive, and create company culture&#8230; something <em>every</em> company can appreciate.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #00cc99">Give Yourself a Break!<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #00cc99">Work-Life Balance is Good Business.</span></h1>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Although work-life balance is important, according to </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/running-a-small-business-is-no-vacation-ondeck-study-finds?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=bizownersneedabreak&amp;utm_content=article1"><span style="font-weight: 400">this OnDeck study</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, only </span><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>57%</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of small business owners take a vacation during the year. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is one thing in this world that I am certain of it is that <strong>business owners never truly turn off</strong>. You may look like you’re “taking a break” or “on vacation,” but every family member of a business owner knows better than to believe that facade. (Trust me, I’m married to one.) But what if I told you that taking a break, a real break, as in you really don’t think about work, whether it be for an afternoon, a few days, or even a couple of weeks, could be <strong>the best thing for your business and your health</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies"><span style="font-weight: 400">HBR article</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> points to a study that shows that overworking yourself leads to several health issues including lack of sleep, impaired memory, and heart disease. And negatively affects the bottom line from loss of focus, reduction of interpersonal skills, and impaired judgement calls—making work-life balance an important part of building a successful business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #ff474a">Here are <strong>three reasons</strong> to give yourself a break and add a little work-life balance, if the above didn’t convince you yet. </span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>1) Taking care of yourself is taking care of your business:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your business is only as good as you are. If you don’t </span><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/how-to-manage-a-better-work-life-balance-this-summer?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=bizownersneedabreak&amp;utm_content=article3"><span style="font-weight: 400">let yourself relax once in a while</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400">, you’re not doing what’s best for your bottom line. I have a travel addiction, so I force my business-owner-husband to go on vacation for at least a couple weeks a year. Before we met, he had not taken a real vacation in ten years! I do all the planning, but he shows up, generally enjoys himself, and he has said (to my face) that having a break helps him run his business better the rest of the year. (Not to take <em>all</em> the credit for his success, but in the 4+ years we’ve been together his business has grown over 200%. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>2) Distance creates perspective:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting away allows you to get out of the weeds and <strong>gain some perspective</strong>. Meeting new people, experiencing new things, and just getting some time to think will give you some much-needed distance from your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>3) Enjoy quality time with your friends or family:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s no longer a secret that spending quality time with your friends &amp; family is important, and business owners definitely <strong>don’t get enough of it</strong>. If anything, you deserve some time to sit back, relax and enjoy the people around you who make life worth living.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;color: #ff474a">Now that we’ve established it’s better for you and your business to take a vacation. Here are <strong>five steps</strong> to prepare your business for your well-deserved break.</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>1) Look at your calendar:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We know that summer may be <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/seasonal-small-business">your busy season</a></span>. Find a time in your schedule that has the least amount of deliverables due, meetings, etc. Carve out those dates and book the time you need to get away</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>2) Prepare your employees:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Select someone you trust to man the ship in your absence. Your vacation is an <strong>opportunity for a team member to step up</strong> and take the reigns. They’ll want it, and they won’t want to let you down. It may even pave the way for a rising star to come out of the woodwork.  Make sure that person left in charge knows what decisions they are allowed to make and what needs to wait until you return. Finally, that person should know where you are and how to reach you, in case of an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a previous job, I was put in charge when the boss went out of town and while he was flying one of the employees and the primary stakeholder of a project due the next day quit. Without being able to reach him, I had to step up, deal with the situation, and make real decisions to push the project forward. It went off without a hitch! My boss (and I) recognized that I could handle the pressure and more responsibility.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>3) Let your clients know in advance:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have a client based business, <strong>let them know you’re leaving</strong> and when you’ll be back. Make sure they know who to contact in your absence and explain to that person what they need to know about any current issues clients are facing.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>4) WiFi exists everywhere:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when I was backpacking through rural India, in the summer of 2008, internet access was available everywhere. (Even though I told my parents that it wasn’t&#8230; sorry Mom and Dad.) So I doubt in 2017, there are many places left in the world where you can’t get online if you need to.  <strong>If there is an emergency, you&#8217;ll be able to get in touch</strong> and address the issue. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>5) Schedule your check-in time:</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know what I’m about to say is counter-intuitive to everything else I’ve said in this article. But if you or your business owner family member is anything like my husband, 15 minutes of checking your email in the evening will keep you up to date on any issues and give you peace of mind that your business isn’t burning to the ground without you there. <strong>Pick an agreed upon time of day and time limit of checking-in</strong> before you leave on your trip to avoid any squabbles during your vacation.</span></p>
<p><strong>P.S. I’ll keep you posted on how successful our vacation next month is. (update: It was incredible!)</strong></p>
