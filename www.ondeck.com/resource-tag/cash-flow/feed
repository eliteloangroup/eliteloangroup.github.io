<p style="text-align: center"><em>“Metrics that Matter”</em> <em>is a four-part series designed to deliver a pathway and a practice to the most impassioned small business owners.  The ones that built their companies not because they had a background in business but a passion for delivering the kinds of products and services they clearly saw a need for delivered at a service level that was missing from the marketplace.  This series is designed to empower and elevate you and your team so that you can win the game. </em></p>
<p>Small business is filled with big stories.  Every owner has the “catching the biggest fish” story and the “business near death” story where victory was snatched out of the jaws of defeat at nearly the last minute. If you look behind the scenes of these stories you’ll see that every story ends with this point: “cash is king.”</p>
<p>Any one-on-one conversation between small business owners moves from talk of a variety of amazing achievements to the sticky situations that they have gotten themselves into while working on their amazing achievement. Underneath this storytelling is an axiom that cash is king.  Yes, in small business, the more cash you have, the less vulnerable you are and thus, the more powerful you feel.  You can be the smart person who can take advantage of the buyer’s market or purchasing bulk inventory at a particularly favorable price to offset your cost of goods sold for the next quarter if you are flush and have great cash management best practices.</p>
<p>Being flush is the best feeling in the world for a small business owner. Why? Because having enough cash in the bank to float the business “rain or shine” in “good times and bad” and all of these other cliched sayings is the way to have the freedom that we all sought when we started our small businesses.  When you have cash, you can feel good natured or generous even if your largest customer is late in paying their big bill, it gives you the confidence that you can continue operating in a manner that feels more comfortable than hustling and living on the possibility that tomorrow you’ll be able to sell more than you did today.  Being flush is the source of delicious and deep sleep something that might have evaded entrepreneurs since starting their businesses.</p>
<p>Having a clear set of best practices around how you manage your cash will help you create stable margins in your business which breeds predictability, a cushion of cash and the freedom to grow your business.  When you manage your accounts properly, you will be able to predict your inflows and outflows which is key to business performance. Your cash management capabilities impact every aspect of your business.  Let’s take a look at cash management best practices that will help you gain control, confidence and margin stability in your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Practice #1: A weekly cashflow journal while you’re learning the ropes</strong></h3>
<p>Starting a business means learning how cashflows come into and go out of the business.  Using a weekly cash flow journal is the simplest way to learn about the burgeoning patterns of cashflows. You can easily do this journal with a pencil and a preprinted calendar, set up a notebook specifically for this task or use an excel spreadsheet that you make.</p>
<p>You are recording all the revenues you receive daily and from which customers for what items or services, if they are recurring or one-time payments. Then you record your daily expenditures—what bills have you paid, what they are for and if they are a one-time or recurring payment.  At the end of the day, add up your revenues and reduce the number by your expenses to get your daily cashflow numbers. If you have a business with lots of transactions like an ice cream shop or restaurant, you can batch these transactions by income stream—for example: make an income line item for in-store sales, wine or beverage sales, and a line item for wholesale revenues (i.e. for selling ice cream to restaurants) for example.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to arrive at the same outcome as the business owner with a marketing consulting company that might have relatively few daily transactions. You will start to understand how cash is moving in and out of your business. This commences the process where you can start intuiting the rhythms of your business—the ebbs and flows of your daily activities. From this place, you are able to tweak and tune how much you’d like to sell to hit your target metrics for sales and the net cash you’re able to take away at the end of the day.  Using a cashflow journal has you learn what kinds of sales results you are producing, what kinds of expenses you are racking up, what days are the most busy for sales and the frequency in which you’re paying out money.</p>
<p>This kind of activity has you, the business owner, start generating the numbers for your first metric called in short hand, “the acid test.” The acid test has you understand the ratio between current assets and current liabilities. Your goal is a “high liquidity” business especially for those of you who are just starting out.  A high liquidity means that you’re able to pull cash to cover unexpected expenses, or buy materials if you find a great deal.  The rule of thumb for good cash management is your income should be at least twice that of your liabilities. That is the metric that will make you feel confident that you’ll be able to consistently pay your bills regardless of if you’ve received terms or not from your vendors.  The journey from newbie to becoming a crackerjack with cash is the first great journey an entrepreneur takes.  In becoming masterful, you are taking the cash journal from an intellectual exercise and making it an action that becomes second nature. This will have you become a pro at making cash king in your business in no time.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Practice #2: Treating Cash as Three Different Revenue Sources</strong></h3>
<p>Cash is cash is cash, right?  Well, let’s unpack this.  Thinking that there is more than one kind of cash will have you treating your cash flow differently. Treating your cash differently will change your relationship to the cash that comes in and how you’ll be able to use that money inside the business.   First, there is operating capital. This is the money that you need now to keep your business running.  This is the kind of cash you make payroll with and buy materials with—this cash is the basic and essential use for cash. Then there’s financing capital which you want to set aside for growing the business.  You need cash for things like a down payment for equipment or buying a building.  Then there is R&amp;D money—the money that you need to develop new products and services. Too often entrepreneurs try to fuel their R&amp;D efforts from the same pool of operating capital that keeps the business afloat.  This is a sure way of short changing your R&amp;D because as we all know, operations will need more or less money to keep operating dependent upon growth.</p>
<p>If you tag the cash that comes into your business for different purposes, you will segment that capital in a manner that helps you set aside money for the things you want—almost like a vacation saving account you can get at a bank.  Harry Lowenstein, my SCORE mentor in NYC, told me this ditty, “every dollar has a job.” So true, so true Harry! If I have money that I’m not certain what to do with, I’ll spend it somewhere on something that later on, I’ve mostly come to regret.  When every dollar has a job, every dollar is assigned to a line item or budget item, ensuring that you’re funding the things that you want rather than spending on things that you don’t want in the long run.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Practice #3: Create a Great Cashflow Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Most startup entrepreneurs have to learn the ropes to creating an environment that has customers pay fast and on time.  A rookie mistake that so many new business owners make is starting out offering terms when they need cash and sales the most. Most of these startups can’t afford to offer terms.  This leads automatically to a precarious cashflow situation and many sleepless nights.  So how do small business owners set up the rules of engagement? Small business owners must create the pathway for customers to know how to pay. Different conventions for different industries help illuminate a way that payments are made and accepted.</p>
<p>Let’s think about that restaurant example again—diners come in and order their meals and receive a check at the table when they’re finished with their dining experience—the waitperson gets a check ready, hands it off to the diner and is ready for payment. Most diners know this convention. The same restaurant might do big catering. A sizable deposit is expected for a large catering. A caterer asking for a deposit is part of the convention that this industry dictates and meets the expectation of the client. The caterer might take checks, credit cards, cash, PayPal, Square or Venmo to make payments easy for clients. These familiar patterns have customers feel comfortable for paying at least a portion of their payment upfront.  The right environment tells your clients how they are going to pay for your products or services—and this is key to your business model working and the conditions for your cashflows.</p>
<p>We’ve just talked about best practices so that you can get your cash game on like an old pro. Now listen and learn from these “Most Definitely Don’ts” so that you can avoid the common mistakes of junior level cashflow management.</p>
<h3><strong>Most Definitely Don’t #1:  The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions</strong></h3>
<p>Saint Bernard Clairvaux said “the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.” Hell for small business owners means cash is tight and uncertainty around customer payments. Small business owners get into the habit of “robbing Peter to pay Paul” because they are focused on servicing the customer and look at payment terms as a means to offering service to customers. Entrepreneurs sometimes confuse what they see as good manners with good business.  Of course, we want to be solicitous to our clients (especially the ones we really like) but most small business owners don’t understand what the cost of servicing the customer is by offering terms indiscriminately.</p>
<p>So what happens when one of those customers doesn’t pay on time or doesn’t pay at all? The small business takes on uncollectible debt or has no recourse to collect these debts other than the courts (time consuming) or through a collections agency (pennies on the dollar) so instead of feeling the discomfort of asking for payment at the beginning of the transaction, the small business owner waits to collect money towards the end of the transaction which increases risk of non-payment, financing fees, and other hidden costs that business owners take on when giving customers terms.</p>
<h3><strong>Most Definitely Don’t #2: Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</strong></h3>
<p>Small business owners don’t like anyone to tell them what to do, right? One the reasons you decided to be your own boss is because you eschew the idea of someone else telling you what to do. So I’m going to tell you a cardinal rule of what not to do… rob Peter to pay Paul.  If you are a general contractor, small real estate investor (landlords and property management) or other professions that have progress payments or long contract and payment cycles, there’s always the inclination to rob Peter to pay Paul—that is use money from one job to cover expenses from another. Here’s why you don’t want to do this first and foremost &#8212; if you rob Peter to pay Paul chances are you won’t be able to catch up in the profit arena.  You simply will ebb away your profit margins by doing this.</p>
<p>Think of the costs for each job as a swim lane in an Olympic sized pool. If each customer is represented by a swimmer, wouldn’t it be weird to see one swimmer hop over the lane divider and start swimming in someone else’s lane? Sure, it would!  You will want to isolate costs to individual jobs especially if a job might get behind in its delivery schedule or encounters other issues.  You will want to cordon off any potential issues of that one job from impacting the others. Keeping accounts clear and staying on top of payments, receivables and collections will help keep your customers in line and your margins straight, and your cash flowing.</p>
<h3><strong>“Cash is King” because Cash is Freedom</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s face it: as a small business owner you want two things: freedom of choice and control. You wouldn’t run a business if you didn’t at core want these two things. Cash management practices are at the heart of your business’ well-being which directly connects to your personal well-being and financial wholeness.  Too often business owner’s optimism and good will towards their customers and clients has them make decisions that negatively impact their financial position.  You might think that you didn’t go into business because of your “financial position” but because you want to fulfill a mission. If you don’t have best practices around cash management you will find that your well-being, overall happiness and business success will be negatively impacted by the very thing that you thought would make you happy.</p>
<p>At the heart of your deepest desires to build that successful small business you had always dreamed about is your ability to take your business idea and bring it to fruition. The key skill for small business owners no matter what industry or business model is proper cash management.  At the intersection of  where your business mission meets your personal commitments, your social purpose and the accomplishments you are driven to deliver lies your level of mastery and ability to create the circumstances that allows your business to thrive.  At the center of this abundance is your masterful cash management. Think about it, what can you and your business do without the rocket fuel that brings you closer to your dreams?</p>

<p>Every success business has three critical business operations under control:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/your-quick-guide-for-planning-a-marketing-strategy">Marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/building-motivating-world-class-sales-team">Sales</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/build-relationship-accountant">Accounting</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I think the first two business operations make a lot of sense (at least they did to me when I was a small business owner), but I don’t think the accounting part of a business is as appreciated by the average small business owner as it should be—at least I didn’t appreciate it as much as I should have. In fact, to steal the idea from one of my friends, Allen Bostrm—CPA and author of the book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-ALLEN-B-BOSTROM-2008-11-06/dp/B01N8Y4Q9T/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535477123&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=in+the+black%2C+Allen+Bostrom">In the Black: Nine Principles to Make Your Business Profitable</a>, he or she who understands what the accounting function of a business is telling them can become the all important profit expert.</p>
<p>When I started my small business, I don’t think I totally appreciated the importance of the accounting process. As a result, I don’t think I ever became the profit expert I needed to be. Since that time I’ve come to appreciate that although you don’t need to be an accountant or accounting expert to build a successful business, there is a lot of valuable information within the financial reports and the accounting process that will absolutely help you become a profit expert and build a more profitable business—if you understand what those financial reports are telling you. But, you need to dig a little deeper than the surface level of understanding a Profit and Loss Statement.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that every business needs a profit expert—but that doesn’t necessarily need to be the business owner (but in many small businesses that’s the logical choice). A good accountant (that you trust) or a bookkeeper could also fill that role. If that’s the route you choose, you need to elevate them beyond the transactional nature of the accounting function and engage with them in a more consultative way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To quote my friend Allen, “Over the years, I have run into countless small business owners who think they are profitable, but who really don’t know. The owner of a window washing company proved to be a typical example of this. He asked me how his business could become more successful. He had clients, and work was plentiful, but he wasn’t making any money. I asked him how he was utilizing the information he periodically received from his Accountant. He said that he only received information once a year in his tax return. BINGO!”</em></p>
<p>If your annual visit with the tax man is the only time you visit with your accountant, you are missing out on a lot of opportunities to add profits to your business. It’s like driving a car blindfolded, because without an understanding of what’s going on within your business financially, you don’t know where you are, where you’ve been, and even where you’re going.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve ever heard the term, “Cash is King,” it could be talking about the role your <strong>Cash Flow</strong> plays in profitability. In my business, I found that whenever a customer took beyond 45 days to pay their invoice, I started losing profits. Anything over 90 days was actually costing me to sell to that particular customer. In other words, I would have been better off not making that sale. Poor cash flow management has rung the death knell for many small businesses and is one of the places a profit expert should focus their efforts.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can still have cash in the bank and be bankrupt. You could have cash enough to meet your obligations this month, but not enough profits to do it next month. How you look at cash flow has to be more than a current, monthly calculation.</p>
<p>Dive into your cash flow ratio. Your current assets include any cash in the bank, your inventory, and your accounts receivable. When you compare the value of your assets with your liabilities (or Accounts Payable and the current part of any other long-term payment obligation, like a business loan or auto lease), the ideal would be to have twice as many assets as liabilities. A 2:1 ratio. Although this is difficult for many businesses to attain, anything below a 1:1 ratio indicates that it’s costing you more money to do business than the income you’re generating.</p>
<p>Here are six tips the average profit expert might take to manage cash flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate your business accounts from your personal accounts. Avoid the temptation to intermingle funds. Don’t use your business accounts for personal reasons.</li>
<li>Manage your cash appropriately and treat it like an asset that should be working all the time to earn interest. Use the cash you need for business operations and put the rest where it can generate more in interest.</li>
<li>Create and use a budget. Work with vendors to try to keep your cash account consistent throughout the year.</li>
<li>Re-invest in your business. New businesses should plan on re-investing at least 50% of their profits back into the company to lesson the amount of capital from other, costlier, sources.</li>
<li>Leverage your cash by negotiating favorable terms with your suppliers that better suit your business needs. Instead of 30-day terms, maybe 60- or 90-day terms could make more sense. Suppliers are often very willing to negotiate with their best customers.</li>
<li>Don’t allow the number of monthly recurring bills and expected receivables each month to get out of control. Watch them like a hawk. This will help you identify potential cash flow problems earlier, rather than later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cash flow is one of the most important things a profit expert needs to watch, but there are a few other important metrics a cash flow expert should regularly pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the daily, weekly, and monthly sales totals?</li>
<li>What are the current cash totals available?</li>
<li>What are the accounts receivable and how old are they?</li>
<li>What are the monthly payroll numbers?</li>
<li>Which products are selling?</li>
<li>Where does the profit come from?</li>
<li>Is our inventory current or obsolete?</li>
<li>What are the major expenses for the business? How much are they?</li>
<li>What are the overhead expenses?</li>
<li>How does the business compare to last year? Last month? Last quarter?</li>
<li>What are the most important numbers you want to see on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis?</li>
<li>What is working well in the business? What needs to be improved?</li>
<li>How is our customer service working?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a small business owner, I would usually try to wait until the end of the day to look at this type of information, which usually meant it got put off until later. I would have been much better served to have started my day in the books looking at these things to become a more skilled profit expert.</p>
<p>Granted, this might not be every small business owner’s cup of tea. If not, take the relationship you have with your accountant, bookkeeper, or CPA from a transactional relationship to a more consultative relationship. They can not only help you understand what these reports are telling you, they can help you create an action plan to make improvements where necessary and capture more profits where possible.</p>
<p>Every business needs a profit expert.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> You don't need to be an accountant to be a successful small business owner, but there are a handful of important small business financial metrics every business owner should know like the back of his, or her, hand. Understanding what these numbers are telling you will help you build a healthy and thriving business.</p><ul><li>Make sure you have a handle on your income</li><li>Do you have control of all of your business expenses?</li><li>Do you know your cash flow metric?</li><li>Are your accounts receivables current?</li><li>Are  you on top of your accounts payable?</li></ul><p>Of course these aren't the only metrics you need to pay attention to, but I consider them the top five. Keep reading to learn more.</p>		</div>
		
<p>I don’t think I’m alone when I suggest, that like many small business owners, I didn’t jump into business ownership because I was really excited about small business bookkeeping or accounting. I knew it was part of the deal, but it wasn’t the part of business ownership I was the most jazzed about. Nevertheless, there are important small business financial metrics every business owner needs to know.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that one of my best friends is a CPA and was regularly offering me accounting advice (some of which I actually listened to), like many business owners I know, I thought I had a better handle on the important small business financial metrics  than I really did. Looking back, I recognize that with a better understanding of what I didn’t know at the time, my life would probably have been easier.</p>
<p>Understanding your business’ financial metrics, and what those numbers are telling you, is critical to running a successful business, knowing whether or not your business is profitable, or waking up one day to find out you’re on the slow march to insolvency and going <em>out</em> of business. There are a handful of metrics I think every business owner should be familiar with, but I’ll preface my suggestions with the following disclaimer:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<h5>“I’m not an accountant and although I believe, from my personal experience, that these are some of the more important metrics every business owner needs to be familiar with, you should also speak with your accountant or a trusted financial advisor to see if there are any other metrics he or she feels are more important for your business and get their perspective on what these metrics mean and how you should measure them.”</h5>		</div>
		
<p>In addition to being tools to help you successfully run your business, I once spoke with a lender who said, “If I can tell more about a business by looking at the financial numbers than the business owner, I’m not likely to offer them a loan.” In that sense, having a thorough understanding of what your financial reports are telling you also instills confidence in those that work for you, those that offer you credit, or anyone who otherwise helps you to succeed.</p>
<h4><strong>5 Important Small Business Financial Metrics You Need to Understand</strong></h4>
<p>Most of these metrics are pretty straightforward and logical, but hopefully I’ll be able to add something based upon my experience as a small business owner and shed some light on how I monitored these metrics in my business.</p>

			<ol><li><strong>Income:</strong> Without business income, or revenue, nothing else happens. Nobody gets paid. Products don’t get delivered. Supplies can’t be purchased. Without revenue, businesses can’t sustain operations. In my opinion, this is one of the first metrics you need to be intimate with. I tracked this number daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually so I could compare how I was doing today with how my business was doing last year, month, week, etc.<br /><br />This is an important number to a lender, for example. Because one of the things they are trying to evaluate when they review your loan application is whether or not you have the income to make any periodic payments associated with a potential small business loan, without revenue, your business’ ability to service debt will be considered questionable.<br />Fortunately, this is a fairly easy number to capture. What are your total sales?<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Expenses:</strong> There are several ways to categorize your expenses, and your accountant can help you with those; but ultimately, you want to know what it costs to do business and whether or not your business income is sufficient to meet those business expenses. It’s the difference between your income and expenses that determine if your business is profitable or not. After all, profits should be one of the primary goals of going into business for yourself.<br /><br />Granted, there are some businesses today (particularly in the tech space) that forego profits in the beginning and focus more on growth. To do this, they rely on investor income, rather than profits, to fuel the fire of growth before they become profitable. That’s how companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Uber became household names. These investors forecasted that their returns would be exponentially greater by investing today for a potential payout down the road. If your small business has the potential to grow and scale profits with the infusion of capital, you are probably considering this, but most small business owners need to focus on selling their goods or services for more than it costs to produce them so they can generate profits.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> Inadequate cash flow has rung the death knell for many small businesses over the years. If you’ve ever heard the term, “Cash flow is king,” this is what it’s talking about. It’s not enough to simply have money in your business checking account at the end of the month; you need to understand your Cash Flow Metric.<br /><br />You calculate this metric by dividing your assets and your liabilities. This is an important enough metric, that if you’re unsure about how to define assets and liabilities, I encourage you to speak with your accountant to make sure you’re clear on the definitions. The ideal goal for this metric is 2:1, or twice as many assets as liabilities. Understandably, this 2:1 goal is challenging for many businesses to maintain, but anything below 1:1 should be a big red flag that your business doesn’t have adequate cash flow to maintain operations.<br /><br />This can be an important metric. For example, it should be an important part of consideration when looking at a potential small business loan. Because the loan payment becomes a liability, if those payments pull your metric down below 1:1, it could indicate that you are borrowing your way into trouble. Having a handle on your cash flow metric is critical to small business success.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Accounts Receivable Aging:</strong> This is an important metric that you can’t afford to ignore. How long does it take your customers, to whom you offer credit terms, to pay their invoices? If you offer 30-day terms, do they consistently pay in 30 days or do they sometimes go 45 or 60 days.<br /><br />In my business, after 45 days I started to lose whatever profit was in an invoice and after 65 days my profits were entirely gone because of the impact it had on my cash flow. What’s more, for every day over 40 days an invoice was late, it became more difficult to collect. (These timeframes might not apply to your particular business, but it’s worth investigating your situation to determine these numbers for your business.)<br /><br />Needless to say, I worked very hard to ensure that my customers stayed current, and even encouraged them to pay early by offering them a discount on their invoice if they paid within 10 days. Those that took advantage of the discount helped my business by giving me 20 extra days to use that income to increase profits—in other words, the discount was worth it to me.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Accounts Payable Aging:</strong> Another number you should know is the average number of days it takes you to meet your business’ financial obligations. If you’re able to effectively manage your Accounts Receivable, your cash flow, and your income, you should be able to keep your accounts payable current and maybe even take advantage of the prompt payment terms you’re suppliers likely offer you.<br /><br />I know of several small business owners who save enough money by paying their suppliers early and taking the offered discount that they take a big chunk out of payroll every month with the savings. What’s more, if you’re looking at your income and expenses, the ability to take that discount may even positively impact your profitability.<br /><br />As a business looking for borrowed capital, the single most important thing you can do to positively impact your business credit rating and increase the options you’ll have when it comes time to borrow is staying current with your business credit obligations. That includes you utility bills, your business lease, your credit relationships with vendors, and any other business credit obligation you may have.</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>In my opinion, it’s important to have a handle on these five metrics to run a successful business. You may even want to dive a little deeper into one or two of them. For example, you can categorize income streams or identify particular classes of expenses that might make it easier to understand and control. Your accountant or CPA can help you identify the metrics that will give you the most insight into your business.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to ask him or her questions if there are terms or formulae you are unfamiliar with. You accountant should be able to explain them in terms you’ll understand. One of the big mistakes I made as a business owner was treating my accountant as a transactional relationship, rather than a consultative relationship that had the potential of helping me more easily grow my business. In hindsight, I wish I had leveraged that relationship more to my advantage.</p>
<p>Are there any metrics you think I might have missed?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #333333"><strong>We discussed the<span style="color: #0074ff"> 5 financial metrics</span> every small business owner should be looking at.</strong></span></h3>
<p>You don’t need to be an accountant or a small business financing expert to run a successful business, but there are a handful of metrics every small business owner should be very familiar with. Most of the metrics are pretty straightforward and logical, but I’d like to share them with you and some insights I’ve gained over my 35 plus years in small business. I’d also like to point out some of the mistakes I made as a business owner that might help you.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff474a">We talked about:</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">1</span>. Income</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">2.</span> Expenses</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">3.</span> Cash Flow</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">4.</span> Accounts Receivables</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a">5.</span> Accounts Payables</strong></p>
<p>I often made the mistake Michael Gerber, author of The E-Myth Revisited, describes as working “in” my business instead of working “on” my business. In this webinar we’ll talk about how paying attention to these five metrics will help you work “on” your business.</p>
