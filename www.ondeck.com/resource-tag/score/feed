<p>If you’re not familiar with SCORE, you should be. These are men and women all across the United States who’ve retired from leading their own businesses, both large and small, and now donate their time to help small business owners like you build successful and thriving companies.</p>
<p>As part of our partnership with SCORE at OnDeck, I’ve had the privilege of working with many of these volunteers, and have to admit, I wish I’d known about this group of really smart people when I had my own business.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you have questions regarding marketing, accounting, operations, or finance, there is someone at SCORE who can help you build a strategy and execute a plan that will help your business. If you’ve ever thought, “I wish I knew someone who had been there and done that before,” this is the place you need to go.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-172275 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Marc-Goldberg-SCORE.jpg?resize=172%2C258&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="172" height="258" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Marc-Goldberg-SCORE.jpg?w=431&amp;ssl=1 431w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Marc-Goldberg-SCORE.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-recalc-dims="1" />A few days ago, I spoke with Marc Goldberg, a volunteer with the <a href="https://capecod.score.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cape Cod and the Islands SCORE chapter</a>. Before becoming a SCORE volunteer, he’d owned his own successful tradeshow marketing business for 28 years. Because of the seasonal nature of many of the small businesses he works with in Cape Cod, he’s often helping business owners that have a relatively short season to earn profits for the year—from Memorial Day to Columbus Day.</p>
<p>Like most of the SCORE volunteers I’ve met over the last few years, Marc works with brand new businesses, businesses that have been around for a few years, as well as business owners who are thinking about exiting after a successful career. When you are a seasonal businesses, and the population of your community is 214,000 people, with three or four times that during the season, these businesses face some challenges that may be familiar to other seasonal businesses, but completely foreign to many small business owners.</p>
<p>“Good planning with appropriate revenue and sales goals are critical,” he says. “It’s important to have a good accounts receivables plan, to watch your cash every day, along with a plan to finance your business during the off season.”</p>
<p>I think some of this advice for seasonal businesses like those on Cape Cod could apply for any business. When I asked him what he thought the most successful business owners in his area shared, he didn’t hesitate (I think this advice applies to every business):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“They exhibit self-control and restraint.”</strong> Building a successful business may require a little bit of risk taking from time to time, but being able to thoughtfully approach that risk without recklessness is an important trait of successful small business owners.</li>
<li><strong>“They think through the business and understand the dynamics of what makes the business go.” </strong>Many small business owners are what Michael Gerber, in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516033546&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+e-myth+revisited+by+michael+gerber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The E-Myth Revisited</a>, would call technicians. Being a skilled auto mechanic, for example, isn’t all it takes to run a successful auto repair business. Marc suggests, and I agree, that most successful businesses are run by people who understand where and how their businesses make profits, they understand the accounting process, and know what it takes to bring customers in the door.</li>
<li><strong>“They don’t just hope their businesses will be successful.” </strong>Although we all hope our businesses will be successful, we understand that it takes a lot more to make it happen. Thomas Edison once said, “We often miss opportunity because it’s dressed in overalls and looks like work.” The successful entrepreneurs I know all understand that there’s nothing easy about running their own businesses and they typically roll up their sleeves and go to work.</li>
<li><strong>“They are good planners.” </strong>Most of the successful people I know don’t fly by the seat of their pants. They set goals and establish a plan to meet those goals. That’s particularly true for those who lead successful small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>“They recognize they are marketers and are willing to invest in marketing their businesses.” </strong>Growing up in my Dad’s small business, he used to always say, “We’re all in sales.” It didn’t matter what I was doing, I was always a representative of his company whenever I was dealing with customers. I think the same is true for marketing. Every successful small business owner understands that he or she is a marketer. They invest the time and resources required to introduce their businesses to the market and regularly invest in their marketing efforts. P.T. Barnum famously said, “Without promotion something terrible happens. Nothing.”</li>
<li><strong>“They seek advice and assistance when needed.” </strong>Small business owners wear a lot of hats to run a small business, but it’s an unrealistic expectation that they will be experts at everything they do. Smart business leaders aren’t afraid to ask for advice or help when they need it. They look for those who can help their business grow. It could be a good bookkeeper, a copywriter, a good banker, good insurance people, an expert salesperson, or even a mentor—like the folks at SCORE.</li>
<li><strong>“They concentrate on where they’ll get the most return.” </strong>There are a lot of places a business owner can spend his or her time and resources. Successful owners try to spend their time and money where it will provide the most bang for the buck. In other words, they are always trying to maximize the value of everything they are doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a small business in the Cape Cod area, look up Marc Goldberg or one of his colleagues. If you’re not on Cape Cod, you can visit <a href="https://www.score.org/find-mentor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORE.org</a> to find a mentor near you. I’ve personally met with dozens of these business experts from all across the country and without hesitation can recommend them to you. It will cost you nothing to meet with them. They’re trying to give back to the small business community because they understand the important role you play and want to share some of the successes they’ve had. Their advice will help you build a healthy and thriving business—and they have a track record that demonstrates that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Running a small business is no easy feat – as a business owner, you wear several hats to keep your day-to-day operations running smoothly all while strategizing for your business’ long term growth. But how do you find the time to get everything done? Check out these time management tips from David Bobbitt.</i></p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/what-would-you-do-with-33-hours-of-your-time-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, 61% of business owners surveyed told us they’re constantly racing against the clock, 49% said work/life balance is an illusion and 86% said time management is critical to success. So, we’re launching a Time Management Series this week to help you be more efficient, sacrifice less personal time and get one step closer to achieving that elusive work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll hear from David Bobbitt, president of The SCORE Foundation, on his time management tips and work/life balance best practices. <a href="https://core.score.org/ondeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORE </a>is a non-profit organization comprised of 11,000+ volunteer mentors who provide free and confidential small business mentoring and advice.</p>
<p><strong>GUEST POST FROM DAVID BOBBITT:<br />
</strong><br />
At first glance, I am the last person who should ever write a guide for work efficiency. But according to people who know me, I do cover well. So rather than say “hey, here are all the solutions,” read this more as “hey, here are my long list of challenges,” plus some strategies that help me get by.</p>
<p>Big picture first….when you start and run your own business, contrary to expectations, you are simultaneously your own boss and rarely your own boss. By that I mean to do well, you need to enforce discipline around your behaviors. If being your own boss means eating ice cream sandwiches all day while binge-watching Netflix, well let me tell you from personal experience that’s not a good way to grow your business! You get to choose what order you do things in and if and when to get help, but most business functions must occur regularly—bookkeeping, sales calls, inventory, you name it—and those functions are truly the small business owner’s boss.</p>
<p>I had to learn that it was OK to ask for help, a sign of strength, not of weakness. My first business involved renovating and flipping real estate. I was young and stronger than I look. Many times I had to hire people to help me with technical repairs beyond my experience. At first I convinced myself that I would watch them work, say adding circuit breakers to an electrical panel, and learn that task well enough never to need that specific help again. One day—and bear with me because I’m slow—I realized that if I relied on strong professionals who could do part of the job that I’m not so hot at, I could focus on the tasks where my presence is most value added. Which brings me to…</p>
<p><strong>Delegating</strong>. One of the first things a small business owner has to do is to delegate. Now this may not mean hiring employees. Getting help from a virtual assistant, short-term contractor (like my electrician), or a service provider like an accountant can help keep you on track to achieve your goals while still ensuring you get a good night’s sleep on a regular basis. Pitfall to avoid: When you think you are your own best accountant, attorney, electrician, or finance guru—and you don’t have a background in that field—you aren’t! It’s OK to ask for help, and never a sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>. Everyone says that technology helps us be more productive. As Netflix and the video games on my iPad can attest, technology for me often helps me be less productive as well. But let me mention some of the technology-based solutions I use:</p>
<p>1.) Many new business owners are unaware that SCORE offers <a href="https://www.score.org/content/live-and-recorded-webinars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded webinars</a> that can be accessed any time, day or night. We know that many business owners can’t carve out an hour in the middle of the workday to join us for a live webinar, but each gets archived and can be accessed absolutely free. Whether it’s a session about how to access capital or ways to use social media platforms wisely, we cover it all. I can’t recommend these webinars enough &#8211; they’re such a valuable resource and we’re proud to offer them for free. Binge watch and learn!</p>
<p>2.) <a href="http://www.tripcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripCase</a> is an app I started using at my consulting business. It’s great for putting all the components of a trip—flight, hotel, car—in one handy location and it generates calendar items for my calendar. TripCase helps me get the most out of any travel. There are likely other apps out there too that can help, so you should check them out to see which works for you.</p>
<p>3.) <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meet-me-in-the-middle/id826982528?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meet Me In The Middle</a> is a great app when you need to set up meetings or meet with a group of people and want to find somewhere halfway for everyone. Just enter each address, and you can figure out what’s halfway. My business team was virtual, so when we decided to meet, it wasn’t as easy as walking down the hall to the water cooler.</p>
<p>4.) Notes for iPhone is one of the best efficiency products ever. All my Notes are synched, so I can take notes anywhere and always be able to find them again using a simple search from any of my devices. Since my memory is sometimes a bottleneck—don’t laugh, it will happen to you one day too—I like the ease of searching Notes.</p>
<p>5.) Social media marketing tools. This is a good news/bad news item in my book. It’s easier than ever to promote your business through social media and online advertising tools, but truly marketing your company requires attention and great care in developing your brand and message. There’s no way to go through the motions just to get it done, like you could do with bookkeeping or perhaps operational tasks. Developing blog posts, social media content, and other forms of marketing can be cost effective, but can take a great deal of time and focus.</p>
<p>6.) Excel. I ran a real estate business for seven years on Microsoft Excel. It is still my go-to tool for figuring out budgets and making estimates. It’s even easier to use today thanks to quick and easy Excel tutorials available on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong>. When I was deeply into my last business, I was a member of a “CEO support group” of peers. It was one of the best experiences of my life. Every business owner needs a support system — it goes back to seeing asking for help as a sign of strength, not weakness. A support system made up of family, friends, and/or colleagues can prevent you from getting tunnel vision as you work toward your business goals. At the same time, they can help motivate you to complete business tasks you’ve been avoiding. Many new entrepreneurs find their SCORE mentors to be helpful in this regard. A mentor is someone who understands the rigors and stresses of starting a business, but also knows that an exhausted business owner isn’t going to accomplish much. A mentor can provide gentle reminders to business owners to be kind to themselves, while also looking for ways to streamline the small business workload and systems.</p>
<p><strong>Last Word</strong>. I had to learn to become patient with myself, and I urge any small business owner to cultivate patience for himself or herself. A new business owner is overwhelmed with not just the possibilities of entrepreneurship, but also with the long to-do lists required to achieve those possibilities. Get to know your working style and find ways to improve it — and don’t sweat what the books and experts say too much. There are a ton of helpful tips out there, for sure, but not every tip works for every business owner. Don’t get hung up on that. Figure out your own strengths, and play to them. Like me, you may never be a paragon of efficiency. But you can learn to be your best as well as your most productive.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding how business credit works is critical as your business grows beyond the first few months or years. As a business owner, it’s important to understand what lenders see when they look at both your business credit profile and your personal credit score—because they both play a role in how lenders evaluate your credit worthiness.</p>
<p>In a recent webinar conducted in partnership with SCORE, we dive into what makes up your personal credit score, and the information the credit bureaus might use to create a business credit profile. We also talk about five things you should be doing now to build a solid profile.</p>
