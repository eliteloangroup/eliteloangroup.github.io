			<p><span style="color: #ffffff"><strong>Article Summary:</strong> The benefits to your business of building a strong online presence for your business purposes are twofold: it’s a way for prospective customers to find your business and a way for current customers to stay engaged. Any time is a good time to check how your business appears online, so why not now!  </span></p><p><span style="color: #ffffff">Here are 6 places that can help you create an online presence for your business:</span></p><ol><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Your Website</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Google</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Facebook</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Instagram</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">LinkedIn</span></li><li><span style="color: #ffffff">Review Sites</span></li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>These six places are by no means exhaustive, but they will help with building your online presence and hopefully grow your ROI. Read below for actions you can take today.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Your Business Website</strong></h3>
<p>When you think of your business’s online presence, your website should be the first thing that comes to mind and where you devote the lion’s share of your efforts. This is where all your other online businesss pages link to, and any changes or updates will start here. Think of it as your home base.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions about your website and make any needed changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Days/hours of operation</strong> – are they up-to-date?</li>
<li><strong>Special holidays and hours </strong>– are you open or closed?</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong> – is it correct, and do you have multiples?</li>
<li><strong>Menus, products, services</strong> – do you have anything to add or remove?</li>
<li><strong>Copyright date</strong> – check your website’s footer to see if that’s current.</li>
<li><strong>Social media icons</strong> – do you have them, and do they link to your pages?</li>
<li><strong>Location/address</strong> – do you have Google Maps installed? Are all your locations listed?</li>
<li><strong>News</strong> – upload recent news articles about your business.</li>
<li><strong>Employees</strong> – do you list your employees, and is that list accurate?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Google</strong></h3>
<p>Your business’s Google listing is very important to keep updated. When a prospective customer is searching for a new restaurant, local plumber, or health care specialist, you want your listing details to be accurate so they don’t go to the wrong location or call the wrong number. There’s nothing worse than showing up at a business and it’s closed when it says open on Google!</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to start and maintain an accurate Google listing. Here are a few things to do on Google:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google My Business (GMB)</strong></a> – claim your free business profile to update to how your business appears in Google search and gain insights into how people are searching for your business. The great thing about GMB is you can get emails to remind you to make updates, such as:
<ul>
<li>Days and hours of operation</li>
<li>Special holidays and hours</li>
<li>Phone number(s)</li>
<li>Google Maps address</li>
<li>Photos &#8211; upload new photos of your business, storefront, and inside, if applicable. Encourage customers to leave photos, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Facebook</strong></h3>
<p>You may or may not have a social media online presence, but you should think of social media as an extension of your website. Facebook is really pushing itself as another search tool, like Google, and there are a few key things you can do to optimize your business Facebook page.</p>
<p>Check out these Facebook action items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a page template</strong> – Is your Facebook page set up to maximize your presence? Check out the Templates and Tabs section under Settings while logged into your business Facebook page. It is likely set to the default Standard template, but you can choose between that or Business, Service, Restaurant, and Shopping. Changing the template will change the tabs that appear on the left-hand side of your business page, but you can preview what those tabs are before you make a change. You also have a choice to turn on/off certain tabs.</li>
<li><strong>Page Info Tab – </strong>After you update your template, stay in Settings. Right above that is the Page Info tab. In there, you can make changes to days/hours of operation, phone number, email, website URL, location, parking availability, public transit, and price range. These changes should automatically update in your About Section, too.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs Tab – </strong>One of Facebook’s more recent changes, you can now advertise any open jobs you have right on your page. Make sure you add/remove jobs when needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Instagram </strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that Instagram is owned by Facebook? You get many of the advertising and posting benefits on Instagram as you would on Facebook. This can help streamline your online presence on both sites.</p>
<p>Things to look out for on Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sign up for Instagram Business Tools</strong> – take advantage of the following items by either signing up or upgrading your current Instagram account to Instagram Business. You can do that by going to your current profile and clicking on Edit Profile. The prompt should be right below your bio.</li>
<li><strong>Business bio</strong> – Similar to Facebook’s About section. Provide a brief and accurate description of your business products or services.</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong> <strong>URL</strong> – add your business’s website. This is the only place where you can have a link in Instagram. Links do not work in photo or video posts.</li>
<li><strong>Category </strong>– ensure your Instagram account is categorized correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Options</strong> – you can include your email, phone number, and business address.</li>
<li><strong>Action Button</strong> – find this under Contact Options. Give your customers a call-to-action, like “book,” “reserve,” and “order,” through third-party integrations like OpenTable and GrubHub.</li>
<li><strong>Photos </strong>– you want to make sure you have fresh photos uploaded weekly. If you want, you can post the same exact thing on Instagram as your Business’s Facebook account at the same time. Just make sure they are linked.</li>
<li><strong>Hashtags </strong>– when you do post, use appropriate hashtags so people who are not your followers can find your business page. Use as many relevant hashtags as possible to broaden your reach.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> 5. </strong><strong>LinkedIn</strong></h3>
<p>You may already have a personal online presence via your professional LinkedIn page. But LinkedIn is also good place to build out your business’s online presence, too.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can do on LinkedIn:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On your Professional Page</strong> – Make sure your Title and Contact info, Experience (i.e., your business), and Summary are updated. Provide a clear headshot, and wear branded clothes, if applicable. In your contact info, you can provide your business email, phone, address, and website URL.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Company Page</strong> – If you don’t already have a LinkedIn profile for your business, you can create one while you’re logged in to your professional profile. At the top right of the page, next to your picture, is the “Work” dropdown. Click that, and at the bottom, there is an option to “Create a Company Page.”</li>
<li><strong>Company Page to-dos &#8211; </strong>Once you have a Company Page, you can fill out the profile to include your website, phone number, jobs, and photos.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>6. Reviews</strong></h3>
<p>There’s a good chance that prospective customers are shopping around before they decide to patronize your business. Today, 65 percent of the buy journey starts with online search.  Having positive, recent reviews are an important part of building your business online presence and helping people who are looking online for your products or services to find your business.</p>
<p>Where should you collect reviews? Both <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> have review collection functions, and both also display your star rating of 1*-5* next to your business profile when someone searches for it. For Facebook, you’d need to turn on the Reviews Tab to display reviews.</p>
<p>Also consider industry-specific review sites. You want to go where your customers are searching for your business. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.angieslist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Angies’ List</strong></a> –for service provides</li>
<li><a href="https://www.opentable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OpenTable</strong></a> and <a href="https://resy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Resy</strong></a> –for restaurants</li>
<li><a href="https://services.amazon.com/amazon-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> –for businesses that sell online</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask, and ask often. Fresh reviews show engagement with your website, and search engines like Google look favorably on that increase in traffic—so make sure you’re regularly asking your customers to review your business and talk about why they like doing business with you.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t hurt to show reviews on your website. As a best practice, it’s a good idea to link to the review or to the review site so prospects can do their own research.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Stay on top of it!</u></strong></h2>
<p>It may sound like a lot of things to tick off the list, but you need to consider what type of online presence makes sense for your business before you dive in.</p>
<p>You may have time to knock out these action items in an afternoon and set up monthly reminders to make sure everything is still up-to-date. Or if your team has bandwidth, appoint one or two employees to make sure the listings are accurate, and that reviews are coming in. Delegation can be your friend!</p>

			<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Article Summary<br /></strong>Social media can be a great tool for your small business.

<p>Your business knows social media is important, but where do you begin? Digital advertising revenue, driven by networks like Facebook, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/03/advertising-trends-2017.html">expected to increase 18 percent</a> year over year to reach $229 billion this year. Social is where the people are, where they’re consuming media, where they’re interacting with friends and getting recommendations, where they’re looking to discover new brands and products that fit their needs, and so much more.</p>
<p>Where your business spends its time and money can get out of hand without strategy. Here are some ideas for how to focus your efforts on the right networks, using the right tools, to save your business money and improve return on investment.</p>
<h4>Use Built-In Network Applications</h4>
<p>Even if your small business doesn’t have the budget to work with an agency on social media or hire someone full-time in-house to handle it, the good news is that networks are free and most have built-in reporting tools to provide you with insights. Some, like Facebook, even offer scheduling features.</p>
<p>When it comes to the social media networks your business should be on, here’s a look at some you might consider:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>Facebook: </strong>The big daddy of social networks, the site has 1.94 billion monthly users, with more than 68 percent of adults using it. Considering its large market share, Facebook should be the number one priority for B2C businesses to have a presence on. You can share photos, videos, text updates, slideshows and more, and schedule posts ahead of time within the Facebook app. The site has rich reporting features built into every business page profile, including info on when your users are on the site and how many people interact with each post.</li><li><strong>Twitter: </strong>Twitter has 328 million monthly users, which may seem to pale in comparison to Facebook, but it’s important to realize some of the most important people to your brand are often avid users on the network: journalists, bloggers and influencers. The platform gives brands the capability, unlike Facebook, to directly message any user who follows the brand page. This makes it easier for your business to build relationships with influential users and get more press. The network also has a free analytics tool that shows top Tweets and followers.</li><li><strong>Instagram: </strong>Powered by Facebook, Instagram is key for any visually-minded brand like a restaurant or clothing store. With 700 million monthly active users, businesses that can shine visually through photos or videos should have an Instagram. An Instagram account is essential to brands in verticals like fashion, hospitality, food and beverage, and art, but any business can use the network to show off company culture or re-share posts from followers to engage with consumers. Instagram business users get a free insights tool that shows follower demographics, follower growth and impressions.</li><li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> Pinterest has 150 million users, and like Instagram, it’s a great way for visual brands to get noticed through "pinning" images on vision board-like displays. The network skews heavily female, with <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent of online American women</a> using the network compared with 17 percent of males, so if your brand targets women, you might consider setting up a profile here. Brands with a free business account get free analytics on Pinterest, showing top posts, audience details and stats about your profile.</li><li><strong>YouTube: </strong>Not everyone uses YouTube in a social sense, but with 1.5 billion monthly users, the power of the channel can’t be ignored. If you plan to produce videos, YouTube is key, because you also get the added benefit of keyword-optimized videos showing up in Google search results, the network that owns YouTube. You can also interact with user comments, comment on other videos to connect with more users and add other videos to your own page to build up content if you don’t produce your own. You can schedule videos in advance through YouTube, and YouTube’s analytics provide insight into demographics, traffic sources and watch time.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>A few other social networks your business might consider include:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong>A haven for B2B enterprises, LinkedIn is still a good place for B2C brands to have a presence because there are more than 500 million users on the network. You can post business updates, encourage your staff to grow their personal brands by interacting in LinkedIn Groups, and use free LinkedIn analytics to gauge what type of content works best for your business on the network.</li><li><strong>Snapchat:</strong> If your B2C targets teenagers and millennials, you should consider Snapchat. More than 60 percent of American smartphone users ages 13 to 34 use the social network, which has 161 million users. Photo and video content does well here, which “self-destructs” from the app after 24 hours, making it a great place to share special offers.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Now that you have a better idea of what networks you could be on, here’s how to use these networks to boost revenue.</p>
<h4>Get Organized to Align Social with Sales</h4>
<p>Top brands save time and money by aligning marketing strategy with sales efforts. It seems like a no-brainer to tap into sales objectives and campaigns to power marketing, yet some brands lack a social strategy and then wonder why they’re not getting results.</p>
<p>A content calendar can help streamline your efforts. Agora Pulse and other similar tools, offer a free editorial calendar template. You can map out your entire business year with your sales team in the room. Discuss product launch dates, plans for holiday specials and seasonal trends where certain products should be spotlighted. Use the calendar as a guide to plan your social content, but be flexible enough to adjust content by checking in with sales on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>One brand that boosted its sales initiatives with social is a company I worked with as a consultant a few years ago. They were a local nursery trying to compete with much bigger big box store competitors. They had been in business for many years and had amassed a very complete catalog of advice they shared in article form with customers who visited their store. When I advocated sharing the advice on social media with an offer to meet with a gardening expert who could help them with their particular landscaping or gardening questions, they were not only skeptical, but they though they would be giving away what set them apart from the big box—real, honest to goodness, expertise.</p>
<p>They decided to give it a try. For the next three months we promoted this advice via their blog and their Facebook page. We included an invitation to come into the store and visit with one of the gardening experts about their yard or their garden. The education content shared on social media was so successful, they had to make managing that effort a full-time job for one of their employees—they had that many people visiting the store with questions and ultimately becoming customers.</p>
<p>They have since expanded this effort on Instagram with beautiful images of flowers and garden plants with tips for planting season and other useful information.</p>
<h4>Automate Social Media Posts</h4>
<p>Instead of your social media manager, or whoever’s in charge of social at your startup, having to manually log in to every single social network to post, schedule them all at once in one tool. This way, if you want to have an editor or second pair of eyes view them, they can do this all at once.</p>
<p>Here are three social media automation tools you might consider:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>Agora Pulse: </strong>AP is a great tool that we use here at OnDeck. We love it because it’s such a simple, intuitive platform. You can use it to easily schedule posts for all of your social channels and listen to conversations happening around your business or industry. Their measurement tools are straightforward. Most importantly for a small business owner, you do not need to be a social media maven to utilize this product.</li><li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Similar to Agora Pulse, this social scheduling platform allows multiple users to access various channels and messages within one platform. Besides the scheduling, Buffer has stellar analytics that track engagement, impressions and account performance. The free platform allows two profiles and 10 scheduled posts per profile, while paid accounts increase the more users and platforms there are.</li><li><strong>CoSchedule: </strong>In addition to offering a social media scheduling tool, CoSchedule enables article scheduling and blog post management, plus scheduling for marketing projects. It provides more transparency into the various arms of a marketing department, to help you align your strategy. Plans with social scheduling start at $40 per month.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Using fewer tools for scheduling and reporting saves more of your team time. But how do you know what to pay for?</p>
<h4>Social Media Shopping Tips</h4>
<p>The great news is, all of the tools mentioned above, and many more, offer free trials so startups can see what works best for their team and business needs. Take advantage of these trials by having your employees test them out. Pepper customer service members of each tool with questions as they come up, so you can see how responsive they’ll be when you have problems in the future and how much help they can offer. Before you start the trials, come up with metrics you’ll use to measure just how much time your team is saving, through ease of use and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Ask your staff to reach out to their personal contacts or use forums like LinkedIn Groups to ask others in your industry what they’d recommend. Make social media tools a topic of conversation at your next industry networking event.</p>
<p>You can also request a consultation with each tool’s sales team, so you can explain exactly what you need and see what they offer you. Signing up for a tool can bring it significant revenue over time, and they want your business. Don’t be afraid to let each one know what you want, and have them get to work to show you how they&#8217;ll make the tool work for you.</p>
<p>Continue to ask for input from your team members who end up using the tools once you&#8217;ve signed up, so you can switch services if something is not working. As people get used to working with a tool, they may come to accept frustrations that could be costing you money, so regular check-ins can help keep your team — and your wallet — happy.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of speaking with OnDeck customer, Meghan Garrity, owner of <strong>Performance Detailing, </strong>an auto detailing and performance parts service in Orland Park, IL. We talked about her background, what it&#8217;s like to own a small business, how she and her husband Doug manage the day-to-day, as well as prepare for the future.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: Tell me about your background.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meghan Garrity:</strong> My background is in management. I worked in restaurants for over 15 years, and went through the whole gamut – waitress, bartender, and manager – at a popular chain named after a day of the week. The skills I learned in the restaurant business have helped with managing people and with customer service. Doug’s background is in high performance automobiles, including wrenching and racing. Doug helped build one of the fastest street cars for Sutton Ford when their High Performance Parts department was still open. Doug and his brother race 79’ trans Am and a 70.5’ Trans Am. They are fixtures at Route 66 in Joliet, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How did the idea of your business begin, and what services does your business provide?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Doug always wanted to own some sort of speed shop or detailing business. When he was let go from Ford because of the recession, we thought it would be a brilliant time to open a business. He led Ford’s High Performance Department, so he had a lot of valuable experience. And I always said, if we can start a business during a down economy, we can get through anything.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I wish we knew that the leap of faith was going to be worth the struggle! We started with no employees and no money, so like a lot of business owners we pinched pennies and worked all hours of the night. I was about six months pregnant at the time with our first child and still working a full-time job. Doug would work until midnight and start again at 7am. The shop had to work because that was our livelihood.</p>

<p><strong>OnDeck: How did you start marketing your services? What tactics have you had the most success with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> When we first started, we used any type of free or low-cost option available: social media, flyers, etc. The best marketing so far has been Groupon, social media, and good old-fashioned word of mouth. Groupon was great for advertising because it got our name out there and also helped with referrals. We see a lot of customers now calling and telling us they are on their second or third vehicle that we have tinted, which is really exciting! We also do work for our village’s Public Works Department, and that has been beneficial to getting our name out to a larger local audience, including the police and fire departments. Doug’s ties to the automotive community helps, too, since car guys like doing work with other car guys!</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: You have a storefront and an online store. What are the different ways you market products on both, and are the promotion elements the same or different? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I am able to do most of my marketing from the comfort of my home using different apps and social media platforms. Strategy is mostly the same, but depending on what I am marketing, it makes a difference in whom I am marketing to. Jeep and off-road accessories are usually marketed online, while detailing and tint is usually marketed through email or local platforms. Sales are mostly from local dealership business and online comes from a large Female Jeep club I admin on.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: Speaking of social media, you have a robust presence on a few platforms. What is the key to keeping up with regular posts, and do you have any tips that may help other business owners with their social media? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Social media is extremely important, especially when dealing with a younger demographic. My biggest advice is to stay current and relevant and post and respond often. Follow businesses that inspire you and have a good presence, and this will give you a template for what to post. Also, I use many different apps on my phone for adding text and watermarks &#8211; this helps with uniformity.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How valuable customer reviews to your business, and how do you handle any negative comments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Reviews are important, but unfortunately in today’s world you get fake negative reviews from time to time.  As far as responding to our reviews, we always look to fix any type of negative situation with a positive as soon as we can. Whether the customer is willing to work with us on a resolve is another issue. If we believe the review is false we simple respond with additional questions like “when were you here, what vehicle did you have.” I think our customers are savvy enough to spot a real review from a fake.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> We monitor a lot of metrics including website traffic, Google ads, and Facebook trends. This gives me a good idea of what is working and what isn’t. We can usually see if an ad is working based on the clicks and sales. The weather plays a big part in our sales, too. When the first snowstorm hits, we see products like remote starters skyrocket!</p>

<p><strong>OnDeck: What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What sources of capital did you look into? What did you like about OnDeck?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Financing is hard especially when you are a new business. Banks want to see numbers and a good credit history. We turned to OnDeck for our last 5-6 small loans. Honestly, we researched other banks and companies, and our OnDeck representative is friendly and takes time out to talk with us. It’s the customer service that stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How has OnDeck helped your business grow? ROI, hires, top/bottom line increases, new clients?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> OnDeck has given us the freedom to run our business with peace of mind. It has been a convenient and simple process obtaining the funds needed for our business. We recently expanded and had quite a bit of overhead with new flooring, lighting, displays, and more. OnDeck was able to provide us with the money we needed to make it a smooth transition. With the expansion, we were able to purchase new equipment that helped to speed up operation and increase our profit by 20% in that department.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Doug and I are looking forward to retirement! But until then, we’d like to franchise or open a second location.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business knows social media is important, but where do you begin? Digital advertising revenue, driven by networks like Facebook, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/03/advertising-trends-2017.html">expected to increase 18 percent</a> year over year to reach $229 billion this year. Social is where the people are, where they’re consuming media, where they’re interacting with friends and getting recommendations, where they’re looking to discover new brands and products that fit their needs, and so much more. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about the social media tools available to your small business.</p>
<p>Where your business spends its time and money can get out of hand without strategy. Here is how to focus your efforts on the right networks, using the right tools, to save your business money and improve return on investment.</p>
<h3>Use Built-In Network Applications</h3>
<p>Even if your SMB doesn’t have the budget to work with an agency on social media or hire someone full-time in-house to handle it, the good news is that networks are free and most have built-in reporting tools to provide you with insights. Some, social media tools like Facebook, even offer scheduling features.</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<h5>When it comes to which ones your business should be on, here’s a look at some notable social media to consider:</h5><ul><li><strong>Facebook: </strong>The big daddy of social networks, the site has 1.94 billion monthly users, with more than 68 percent of adults using it. Considering its large market share, Facebook should be a high priority media for B2C businesses to have a presence. You can share photos, videos, text updates, slideshows and more, and schedule posts ahead of time within the Facebook app. The site has rich reporting features built into every business page profile, including info on when your users are on the site and how many people interact with each post.</li><li><strong>Twitter: </strong>Twitter has 328 million monthly users, which may seem to pale in comparison to Facebook, but it’s important to realize some of the most important people to your brand are often avid users on the network: journalists, bloggers and influencers. The platform gives brands the capability, unlike Facebook, to directly message any user who follows the brand page. This makes it easier for your brand to build relationships with influential users and get more press. The network also has a free analytics tool that shows top Tweets and followers.</li><li><strong>Instagram: </strong>Powered by Facebook, Instagram is key place for any visually-minded brand to have a presence. With 700 million monthly active users, brands that can shine visually through photos or videos should have an Instagram. An Instagram account is essential to brands in verticals like fashion, hospitality, food and beverage, and art, but any business can use the network to show off company culture or re-share posts from followers to engage with consumers. Instagram business users get a free insights tool that shows follower demographics, follower growth and impressions.</li><li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> Pinterest has 150 million users, and like Instagram, it’s a great way for visual brands to get noticed through "pinning" images on vision board-like displays. The network skews heavily female, with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/">45 percent of online American women</a> using the network compared with 17 percent of males, so if your brand targets women, you might consider setting up a profile here. Brands with a free business account get free analytics on Pinterest, showing top posts, audience details and stats about your profile.</li><li><strong>YouTube: </strong>Not everyone uses YouTube in a social sense, but with 1.5 billion monthly users, the power of the channel can’t be ignored. If your brand plans to produce videos, YouTube is key, because you also get the added benefit of keyword-optimized videos showing up in Google search results, the network that owns YouTube. You can also interact with user comments, comment on other videos to connect with more users and add other videos to your own page to build up content if you don’t produce your own. You can schedule videos in advance through YouTube, and YouTube’s analytics provide insight into demographics, traffic sources and watch time.</li></ul><h5>A few other social networks your business might consider include:</h5><ul><li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong>A haven for B2B enterprises, LinkedIn is still a good place for B2C brands to have a presence because there are more than 500 million users on the network. You can post business updates, encourage your staff to grow their personal brands by interacting in LinkedIn Groups, and use free LinkedIn analytics to gauge what type of content works best for your business on the network.</li><li><strong>Google+:</strong> Google+ is connected to Gmail account users and claims 375 million users. The benefit of using this social network for posts is that its owned by Google, so optimizing your content with keywords can get your business seen by more Google searchers, too. Its free video “Hangouts” tool allows businesses to host live videos and interact with users.</li><li><strong>Snapchat:</strong> If your B2C targets teenagers and millennials, you should consider Snapchat. More than 60 percent of American smartphone users ages 13 to 34 use the social network, which has 161 million users. Photo and video content does well here, which “self-destructs” from the app after 24 hours, making it a great place to share special offers.</li></ul><p>Now that you know a little more about the networks you could be on, here’s how to use these networks to boost revenue.</p>		</div>
		
<h3>Get Organized to Align Social with Sales</h3>
<p>Top brands save time and money by aligning marketing strategy with sales efforts. It seems like a no-brainer to tap into sales objectives and campaigns to power marketing, yet some brands lack a social strategy and then wonder why they’re not getting results.</p>
<p>A content calendar can help streamline your efforts. Social media tools like Hootsuite, offer free editorial calendar templates. Traditional publishers like magazines are great examples to get inspiration when you’re building your own calendar. Map out your entire business year with your sales team in the room. Discuss product launch dates, plans for holiday specials and seasonal trends where certain products should be spotlighted. Use the calendar as a guide to plan your social content, but be flexible enough to adjust content by checking in with sales on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>One brand that boosted its sales initiatives with social in 2017 was P.F. Chang&#8217;s, a chain Chinese restaurant. In celebration of Chinese New Year, the brand gave away more than <a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-f-chang-celebrating-chinese-174500435.html">one million red envelopes to diners</a> for a month, some of which offered gift cards and vacations across the country. A social element was added to the sales campaign by associating the envelopes with branded hashtags. Photos that contained the hashtag #PFChangsWish were uploaded to a social media feed, which spotlighted user wishes in celebration of the Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>You might want to consider taking a cue from this brand by seeing what items on a sales calendar can get a social boost through social media contests, hashtag promotion, live video broadcasts and other social campaigns. Once you’ve created your content calendar and accompanying posts, save your team tons of time by automating content.</p>
<h3>Use Social Media Tools to Automate Posts</h3>
<p>Instead of your social media manager, or whoever’s in charge of social at your startup, having to manually log in to every single social network to post, schedule them all at once in one tool. This way, if you want to have an editor or second pair of eyes view them, they can do this all at once.</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<h5>Here are three social media automation tools you might consider:</h5><ul><li><strong>Hootsuite: </strong>Hootsuite allows your business to add up to 35 social networks to one easy-to-use dashboard. Create channel streams that allow your team to see scheduled and published posts, interactions with posts, mentions of your brand and more. The platform has a free plan for three profiles, 30 scheduled messages and one user and paid plans start at $25 a month and increase based on users, messages and networks.</li><li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Similar to Hootsuite, this social scheduling platform allows multiple users to access various channels and messages within one platform. Besides the scheduling, Buffer has stellar analytics that track engagement, impressions and account performance. The free platform allows two profiles and 10 scheduled posts per profile, while paid accounts are similar to Hootsuite in that they increase the more users and platforms there are.</li><li><strong>CoSchedule: </strong>In addition to offering a social media scheduling tool, CoSchedule enables article scheduling and blog post management, plus scheduling for marketing projects. It provides more transparency into the various arms of a marketing department, to help you align your strategy. Plans with social scheduling start at $40 per month.</li></ul><p>Using fewer tools for scheduling and reporting saves more of your team time. But how do you know what to pay for?</p>		</div>
		
<h3>Social Media Shopping Tips</h3>
<p>The great news is, all of the social media tools mentioned above, and many more, offer free trials so startups can see what works best for their team and business needs. Take advantage of these trials by having your employees test them out. Pepper customer service members of each tool with questions as they come up, so you can see how responsive they’ll be when you have problems in the future and how much help they can offer. Before you start the trials, come up with metrics you’ll use to measure just how much time your team is saving, through ease of use and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Ask your staff to reach out to their personal contacts or use forums like LinkedIn Groups to ask others in your industry what they’d recommend. Make social media tools a topic of conversation at your next industry networking event.</p>
<p>You can also request a consultation with each tool’s sales team, so you can explain exactly what you need and see what they offer you. Signing up for a tool can bring it significant revenue over time, and they want your business. Don’t be afraid to let each one know what you want, and have them get to work to show you how they&#8217;ll make the tool work for you.</p>
<p>Continue to ask for input from your team members who end up using the tools once you&#8217;ve signed up, so you can switch services if something is not working. As people get used to working with a tool, they may come to accept frustrations that could be costing you money, so regular check-ins can help keep your team — and your wallet — happy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>5 Tips to Evaluating Your Small Business Social Media Marketing </strong></span></h1>
<p>When was the last time you evaluated your small business’s social media marketing strategy? It&#8217;s never a bad time to take a look back, assess, and see where you can make some improvements to end the year on a high note.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these 5 social media questions I believe are essential for small business growth, great customer service, and cost-effective marketing.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>1. Is Your Current Social Media Presence the Right One?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Your business might be active on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, LinkedIn and others. Ask yourself, is this the right strategy? Are you seeing the returns you want on all social media sites, or just some? The key is to know where your customers are active. You do not want to promote your business services or products where they are not – don’t waste your time and resources, especially if you are using paid social.</p>
<p>Limit yourself to where your audience lives, and what is manageable for you or your staff to handle. Remember, social media isn’t a one and done deal. It needs constant nurturing. Don’t create a social media page for the sake of creating one. Every page should have a business purpose!</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164861"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164861" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?resize=1000%2C972&#038;ssl=1" alt="small business social media marketing OnDeck" width="1000" height="972" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_426344605.jpg?resize=768%2C746&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>2. Is Your Social Page Set Up to Sell?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Use your social media page like a landing page for your website to boost your sales. Social media sites have integrated ways for you to sell your product or promote your service very deliberately. This is a great way for you to encourage a transaction, offer coupons, or get a phone call or email, without having a potential customer dropping off on the way to your website. For example, you can set up your business’s Facebook page template to one of 8, which include optimizations for Business, Services, Restaurants &amp; Cafes, and Shopping. Check out your page’s Settings, then go to Edit page to see your options.</p>
<p>Just remember, make sure you have someone (if it’s not you) monitoring your page for direct messages, post comments, and reviews. Social media is all about engagements and fostering relationships. That’s how you can make customer service work on social media – responding in real time. This makes it easy for potential customers to become repeat customers. The fewest amount of steps between fan to customer – with great service – the better.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-164871 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Socal-Media-2.png?resize=516%2C645&#038;ssl=1" alt="small business social media marketing OnDeck" width="516" height="645" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Socal-Media-2.png?w=516&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Socal-Media-2.png?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #0074ff"><b>3. Are you posting content often enough?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The dreaded question. As a small business owner, you don’t want to spend time thinking about what you should post on your social channels each day. You want to run your business! As a best practice, you should post at least once a day, depending on the platform…but it doesn’t have to be brain-wracking or time consuming. Here are a few tips for posting on your small business’s social media.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, know that visual content is the best way to reach the majority of your fans organically (i.e., without spend). Take pictures and videos of your products, team members, and encourage your custcomers to submit content, as well. That’s called User-Generated Content, or UGC. You can screenshot good reviews and share those, or connect with local influencers or bloggers to write about your business, and as a thank you, you can share their content occasionally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Second, for the content that you do want to post, invest in a marketing budget friendly social media content management tool, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.agorapulse.com/"><span class="s2">Agorapulse</span></a>. You can <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/delegation-your-key-to-working-smarter"><span class="s2"><b>delegate a savvy team member</b></span></a> to take care of scheduling weekly content ahead of time if you are using multiple channels. (Facebook has its own scheduling tool built-in if you prefer to use that.) And it’s perfectly ok to re-share content every few months, especially if it already resonated with your audience. Good examples of this are daily hashtags like #ThrowbackThursday, or #TBT. Not only are you reusing content every Thursday, you are taking advantage of a trend and making your content searchable to the greater public.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #0074ff"><b>4. Are you taking advantage of your email lists?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you haven’t made the connection between your established audiences, you need to start that now! Uploading your customer lists and newsletter subscribers to your social media business pages is the best way to send cohesive communications across your marketing channels. Wouldn’t it be great to send a newsletter, a direct mail flier, and a social media ad with the same content? This shows coordination.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can also use uploaded email lists to reward current customers with a coupon…or even better, retarget customers or website visitors (make sure you have cookies on your site) who haven’t shopped in a while, or haven’t made that crucial first purchase.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-164881 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SM-3.png?resize=574%2C747&#038;ssl=1" alt="small business social media marketing OnDeck" width="574" height="747" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SM-3.png?w=574&amp;ssl=1 574w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SM-3.png?resize=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1 231w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #0074ff"><b>5. Are you growing your email list on social media with lead generation?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is all great, you may say, but how do you grow your email list using social media? On Facebook, for instance, once your email lists are uploaded, you can create Lookalike audiences. What Facebook does is use what data is has about the emails you uploaded, and it finds other profiles like it. If ‘Customer A’ shops at your store, then ‘Lookalike Customer A’ might be interested in your product or service, too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to your email lists, you have the ability to create audiences based on interests, purchase behavior, geo-location, age and more. To best do this, think of your average customer, and what they are interested in. For example, if you are selling fly fishing paraphernalia, an interested audience would indeed be fishermen and fisherwomen, but you may also find that kayakers, canoers, hikers, and other people interested in outdoor activities will be interested in your products too. You can get as broad or as detailed as you want.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once you have that audience created, you can set up Lead Generation ads to collect emails from this group. Facebook has a very easy lead generation form where you can collect as much or as little information from your new lead as you’d like. Pro-tip: Less is more, but if you are selling fly fishing items, along with name and email, you can also ask questions about their favorite fly reel brand, or something specific to fly fishing. You can download leads directly from Facebook, or connect your CMS to Facebook so each time a person signs up, they automatically are added to your list.</span></p>
