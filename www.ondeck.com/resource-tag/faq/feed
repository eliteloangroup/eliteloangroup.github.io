<p>Technology is changing everything. From the way we make travel arrangements, shop at the department store, hail a cab—and even the way business owners apply for a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/small-business-loans-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small business loan</a>. Similarly, many lenders are turning to online applications for small business loans.</p>

<p>As more and more people do business on their smartphones, tablets, and computers, it’s no wonder that online applications for small business loans are the preferred choice of many business owners. In fact, one of the top three reasons cited for choosing an online business loan in a survey conducted earlier this year by the <a href="http://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/ETA_Infographic6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electronic Transactions Association</a>, was the easy application process.</p>
<p>Along with speed to funding (63 percent) and affordable total loan cost (51 percent), 57 percent of those surveyed identified that easy online applications are one of the primary reasons they opted for an online business loan. When you consider the traditional weeks-long process and reams of documents associated with a traditional loan application, a simple, easy-to-understand, online loan application makes a lot of sense for time-crunched small business owners.</p>

<h3>Nevertheless, Simply Putting an Application Online Isn’t Enough</h3>
<p>A small business owner shouldn’t have to be a financial expert to complete a loan application; and small business lenders (like <a href="https://online.ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnDeck</a>) are embracing a new paradigm to provide business owners with efficient access to the capital they need to build growing businesses that strengthen communities and create jobs.</p>
<p>By looking at small business lending and the qualification process differently, these lenders are turning traditional credit models that rely heavily on personal credit score and specific collateral on their heads. Since we opened our doors in 2007, we’ve loaned over $10 Billion to more than 80,000 small business owners—which has taught us a thing or two about small business borrowers and how to evaluate a small business’ creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Additionally, a safe and secure online applications process is important to business owners whether they’re borrowing $5,000 or $500,000. At OnDeck, your loan application is protected by encryption and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure your sensitive information is securely sent to OnDeck.</p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions When Applying for a Business Loan</h3>
<p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Do I need collateral to get a small business loan?<br />
</strong>Some lenders, including many traditional lenders like the bank, do require specific collateral for a small business loan, meaning many potentially good borrowers could struggle to access the capital they need because their business doesn’t have the needed collateral to secure a loan. We do not require a specific type of collateral, but do require a general lien on business assets along with a personal guarantee to secure an OnDeck loan.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a business loan without being a corporation? Can a sole proprietor get a business loan?<br />
</strong>You do not need to be incorporated to get a small business loan provided you are a registered business with a business checking account and have a business tax I.D. number. You must also use your business loan strictly for business purposes. However, there may be potential benefits to incorporation and you should consult with an attorney or other trusted legal advisor to determine if changing the nature of your business entity makes sense for your business objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a business loan after a bankruptcy?<br />
</strong>Qualifying for a business loan following a bankruptcy will be more difficult during the 10 years after the bankruptcy appears on your credit report, but there are lenders that will work with your business if the bankruptcy has been discharged for at least two years.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a business loan with a less-than-perfect personal credit score?<br />
</strong>Regardless of the lender, your personal credit score will frequently be a part of your business’ creditworthiness evaluation. Nevertheless, traditional lenders are likely to weight the value of your personal score more heavily than many online lenders do, so if you have an otherwise healthy business and can demonstrate that your business has the cash flow to make timely loan payments, it is possible to qualify for a loan with a less-than-perfect personal credit score.</p>
<p>Because lenders look at your past credit behavior as a way to evaluate what you will do in the future, you should be prepared to explain any extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to your poor personal credit profile. As a general rule, a personal credit score below 680 will make qualifying for a loan at the bank problematic and a score below 650 will likely rule out an SBA loan, so if your personal score is below the 650 threshold, you’ll likely need to look at alternative financing options, but it is possible to gain a loan approval. Nevertheless, taking action to improve your personal credit score, while it might not guarantee a loan approval, will give your business financing options you might not otherwise have.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a business plan to get a business loan?<br />
</strong>Traditional lenders like banks, credit unions, and the SBA often require a business plan, however many online lenders look at other business metrics and don’t require a formal business plan.</p>
<p><strong>What documents do I typically need for a business loan?<br />
</strong>Depending upon the lender there will likely be different document requirements, but having these documents (or at least the information) at your fingertips will make it much easier to apply for a loan at the local bank or an online small business lender regardless of whether or not the documents are required:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Your business financial statements including a Profit and Loss (P&amp;L), an Income Statement, and an outline of your expenses</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Your personal financial information including the last three years of personal income tax returns</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Your business license</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">A copy of your business lease</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">You business bank statements for the last three months</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">See also, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/sba-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“What do I need for an SBA loan?”</a></p>
<p><strong>How do I get a startup loan?<br />
</strong>Aside from the SBA—which has a guarantee program for well-qualified startups—there aren’t a lot of small business loan options for very early stage startups. Most traditional lenders prefer to see a few years in business, although many online lenders (like OnDeck) will work with a business that has at least a year in business. Some non-profit micro-lenders do offer business loans to qualifying startups.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need collateral to get an equipment loan or lease?<br />
</strong>The equipment you are leasing or buying is usually considered the collateral in an equipment lease or equipment loan.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a personal guarantee to get a business loan?<br />
</strong>Small business owners are frequently required to give a personal guarantee when applying for a small business loan.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for a small business loan?<br />
</strong>If you are applying for a loan at the local bank or credit union, you traditionally will meet with a loan officer in the branch office and be given the appropriate forms to complete the application.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for an SBA Loan?<br />
</strong>The SBA is not a lender, but offers a loan guarantee program with banks, credit unions, and other lenders. You can apply at participating banks. The SBA&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/lendermatch">Lender Match</a> tool will help match you to a participating lender in your area.</p>
<p><strong>How do I apply for an online business loan?<br />
</strong>If you apply for an online business loan, you will generally complete a simple online application as described above.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if I can trust an online lender?<br />
</strong>You can start by checking their <a href="http://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/business-reviews/financial-services/on-deck-capital-inc-in-new-york-ny-101780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Business Bureau</a> ranking and look for mentions of them in news organizations like CNBC, Bloomberg, PBS, and others. You can also look for them on third-party review sites like <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/ondeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrustPilot</a>.</p>

<p>A business line of credit can be a valuable tool for small businesses that take a strategic approach to making sure they have access to the resources they require to meet day-to-day working capital needs and fill other short-term financial necessities. It allows them to apply and qualify today for borrowed capital they may need down the road. Many businesses use a line of credit as part of a larger capital access approach including short-term and longer-term financing to fuel growth and fund other revenue-generating projects.</p>
<h4><strong>What Is a Business Line of Credit?</strong></h4>
<p>A business line of credit (LOC) is a revolving loan that allows access to a fixed amount of capital, which can be used when needed to meet short-term business, needs. A LOC is one of the tools a business can use to finance short-term working capital requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing inventory</li>
<li>Repairing business-critical equipment</li>
<li>Financing a marketing campaign</li>
<li>Bridging a seasonal cash flow gap</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>There are two types of business LOCs:</strong></h4>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">1</span> Secured Business Line of Credit—</strong>This type of LOC requires the business to pledge specific assets as collateral to secure the line. Since a line of credit is a short-term liability, lenders typically ask for short-term assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory. Lenders don’t often require capital assets, such as real property or equipment, to secure a LOC. If the borrower is unable to repay the line, the lender will assume the ownership of any collateral and liquidate it to pay off the balance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0174ff;">2</span> Unsecured Business Line of Credit—</strong>This type of LOC does not require specified assets as collateral—however a general lien and personal guarantee will likely be required. Because there is no specified collateral associated with this type of credit line, the business will likely need a stronger credit profile along with a positive business track record to qualify. Additionally, interest rates may be slightly higher; and unsecured credit lines are often smaller.</p>
<h4><strong>A Business Term Loan vs. a Business Line of Credit</strong></h4>
<p>From a lender’s perspective (both traditional lenders like banks and online lenders offer business credit lines) a line of credit and a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/guide-small-business-borrowing">term loan</a> are very different. For example, when a lender evaluates your creditworthiness for a term loan, they are looking at a business’ credit profile to make a decision about a loan today. For a line of credit, they are looking at a business’ credit performance today, to make decisions about the creditworthiness of the business at some time in the future when it accesses the credit line. To a lender, these are two very different situations and could explain why the qualification process for a line of credit might be a bit more thorough.</p>
<p>That’s not the only difference between a term loan and a line of credit. A term loan involves a fixed amount of funds, which the business receives in a lump sum once the loan is approved. Periodic payments are typically repaid over a defined period of time, or term, in a prearranged schedule of payments until the balance is paid in full.</p>
<p>A business line of credit also includes some additional flexibility that is not part of a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/small-business-loans">small business loan</a>. A LOC is fundamentally a credit limit a business can borrow against whenever they need it, repay, and use again—often for a specified term. Most lenders require the LOC balance be brought to zero at some time during the term of the credit line.</p>
<p>LOCs are often used for short-term operating purposes and for more immediate revenue-generating activities because the business can access the funds as needed.</p>
<h4><strong>How Does a LOC Work?</strong></h4>
<p>When you open a business line of credit, the business receives access to a stated amount of funds to use as needed. A monthly statement reflecting the amount of credit used will also include any interest charges (unlike a term loan, you only pay interest for the funds you use as you use them).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, your payment, and the interest, is based upon the funds you use. Once repaid, the credit limit is available to be accessed again as needed. The periodic payment schedule to repay a line of credit will vary depending upon the lender. Either a weekly, or monthly, periodic payment schedule is common.</p>
<p>In addition to the interest charges, an annual fee for a LOC is not uncommon. If your business frequently accesses the LOC, transaction fees may also apply.</p>
<p>Small LOCs (under $100,000) can operate like a credit card account, with advances made by using a credit card tied to the line of credit or by writing checks issued for the account. Some lenders also offer the option of depositing funds directly into the business bank account via an ACH deposit.</p>
<h4><strong>When Should a Business Consider a LOC?</strong></h4>
<p>If your business regularly requires access to funds to meet short-term capital needs to manage the business’ day-to-day capital requirements, then applying for a LOC might make sense. Here are a few examples of situations where a LOC could be a good idea:</p>
<p>Example #1: A seasonal business that generates most of its sales in the summer could use a LOC in the offseason (provided they had the cash flow to make the periodic payments) to help cover overhead as they bridged from one season to the next. The LOC could allow them to maintain normal business operations even though their income fluctuates.</p>
<p>Example #2: A small business could use a LOC to finance a marketing campaign, which would attract new customers and expand sales. The borrowed funds could be paid off quickly because the campaign would potentially generate additional revenue.</p>
<p>Example #3: If a business needed to cover expenses while waiting for a client to make payments on an invoice, a LOC could be useful for cash management.</p>
<p>A new business without an established business credit profile or a business owner with a low personal credit score will likely have a difficult time qualifying for a LOC. Most lenders prefer to offer a LOC to more established businesses with a track record and revenues to support the more flexible financing provided by a line of credit.</p>
<h4><strong>Who Offers Business Lines of Credit?</strong></h4>
<p>Most major banks that serve small businesses—including commercial banks, community banks, in addition to credit unions—offer business lines of credit. Many online lenders, like <a href="http://www.ondeck.com">OnDeck</a>, also offer business lines of credit.</p>
<p>Lenders will usually only consider more established businesses with a positive credit history for a line of credit. For new businesses (under 2 years old), some banks offer LOCs backed by the Small Business Administration. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/oca/resources/4918">SBAs CAPLine Program</a> offers eligible businesses the option of four different types of LOCs to help finance their short-term capital needs.</p>
<h4><strong>Applying for a Line of Credit</strong></h4>
<p>Like a term loan, most lenders will want to see financial records and documents that demonstrate a track record and demonstrate creditworthiness. Traditional lenders like banks and credit unions will require some additional documentation online lenders might not require, so it’s a good idea to find out before your first meeting with the lender what will be required. Some of the basic information you’ll need to apply could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business License</li>
<li>Tax Returns</li>
<li>2-3 months of bank statements</li>
<li>A business bank account</li>
<li>Standard financial documents like P&amp;L, AR, AP, Cash Flow, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be prepared to discuss the specifics of the business’ financial position with the lender, so any documents you may be unfamiliar with you should consult with a trusted advisor like your accountant or CPA to make sure you understand exactly what the documents suggest about the financial health of your business.</p>
<p>As a general rule, lenders will rarely offer a LOC to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea stage companies or startups</li>
<li>Cover losses on past operations</li>
<li>Meet immediate expenses that won’t necessarily lead to profits</li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate the business is qualified for a LOC, be prepared to show:</p>
<ul>
<li>The business is profitable of generating additional revenues</li>
<li>Management understands the financial aspects of running a business</li>
<li>The business has a plan for the LOC to cover specific expenses at specific times and can demonstrate its ability to make the periodic payments</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What You Need to Know Before Opening a Line of Credit</strong></h4>
<p>Before opening a LOC, make sure you understand your chosen lender’s qualification criteria, loan conditions, interest rates, and fees.</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be charges for account set-up, transactions, and annual fees. For example, a bank may charge an opening fee of $150 (or more depending upon the credit account) with no annual fee for the first 12 months, but an annual fee at the beginning of the second year.</li>
<li>In order to reduce risk, it’s not uncommon for the lender to require the business pay down their outstanding LOC balance to $0 at some point during the year, often for at least 30 days. This assures a lender that the borrower is generating sufficient cash flow to operate independent of the LOC, and not relying on the financing as a substitute for cash flow or owner’s capital.</li>
<li>Due to the unpredictable nature of the market, a lender might reserve the right to call any LOC payable immediately. This means the full balance would have to be paid and the LOC reduced to zero without warning. If your business depends on the line of credit, this can be a critical impediment, so the business should always be prepared to either replace the LOC or scale back in order to weather the loss of credit.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>3 Tips on Keeping a LOC</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Periodically pay down your balance and avoid keeping your average running balance near your credit limit. This will show your lender you know how to leverage the value and flexibility of the LOC.</li>
<li>Using a LOC to cover operating losses is not the best option—it will make repayment difficult.</li>
<li>Think strategically about your capital needs for the year to determine the best time to apply for a LOC. Lenders are more inclined to grant a credit line when the business cash flow is strong.</li>
</ol>
<p>A business line of credit can be a valuable tool to fuel growth and fund other profit-generating initiatives. They offer the financial flexibility to cover gaps in normal cash cycles, can be used to harness resources to maintain year-round business operations for seasonal businesses, and can fund expenses that build value and amplify success in concert with other financial tools.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated: Feb. 21, 2019</em></p>
<p>We want to make getting business financing from OnDeck as easy as possible. And we often get asked the same questions by small business owners looking to take financing for their business. So, we want to share the top 10 questions we get asked and answer them for you.</p>
<p><strong>1. What products do you offer?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck offers true small business <strong>Term Loans</strong> and <strong>Lines of Credit</strong>.</p>
<p>We have one simple application for both term loans and lines of credit, so we can present you with all of the financing options available to you and your business.</p>
<p><strong>2. What are your loan amounts and terms?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck offers Term Loans from $5,000 &#8211; $500,000 over 3-36 months.<sup> 1</sup></p>
<p>Our Lines of Credit go up to $100,000 with payback on draws up to 12 months. (The lines of credit are revolving, so as you pay it back your available funds increase.)</p>
<p><strong>3. How does the application process work?</strong></p>
<p>Our application takes minutes to complete! You can apply <a target="_blank" href="http://online.ondeck.com"><u>online</u></a> or over the phone by calling (888) 269-4246.</p>
<p>We’ll only need your basic business and owner information to apply and 3 months of your most recent bank statements.</p>
<p><strong>4.Will my credit be impacted by applying?</strong></p>

<p>Small businesses have more financing options today than ever before, yet navigating the maze of loan types and lenders can make it challenging to choose the right loan and the right lender for your business. The days when the bank was the one-stop-shop for small business loans are over. Meaning, business owners need to be savvier about evaluating their loan options. Before you get a small business loan, there are 14 questions you should ask—four you need to ask yourself and 10 you need to ask your potential lender.</p>
<h3><strong>Before You Get a Small Business Loan, Ask Yourself:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">1.</span> What do I need the extra capital for?</strong> In other words, why do you need a loan? It seems like a pretty straightforward question, but it’s a question often overlooked by borrowers looking for extra capital. The reason I believe this should be the first question is because articulating loan purpose will help answer some of the other questions you’ll need to ask.</p>
<p>Your loan purpose will help you identify whether you’re trying to fill a short-term or a long-term need. For example, the financing needs of purchasing quick-turnaround inventory are decidedly different than those of purchasing an expensive piece of heavy equipment or a new location for a restaurant. It might not make sense, for example, to borrow with a four- or five-year term to pay for inventory that will be sold in a month or two.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/ETA_Infographic6.pdf">A recent survey</a> of 592 small business owners sponsored by the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA) and conducted by Edelman Intelligence revealed that most business owners who borrow online anticipate a 5X return for every dollar they borrow. The most common reasons for seeking those business loans were to purchase equipment (54 percent) or to purchase inventory (51 percent).</p>
<p>Identifying the purpose of your loan will help you identify the term of the loan that makes the most sense to meet your needs. As a general rule, the shorter the term the higher the periodic payment, but the lower the total dollar cost. Longer-term loans typically have a lower periodic payment, but the total dollar cost of accrued interest, or total cost of the loan, will be higher (this is often true even if the APR for the shorter-term loan is higher than the long-term loan).</p>
<p>You might be surprised to know that 57 percent of the small business owners in the survey chose a shorter-term (six-month) loan to minimize the total interest cost when compared to a longer-term loan.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">2.</span> How much money am I looking for?</strong> This is another pretty straightforward question. Unfortunately, popular culture has many business owners convinced that a lot of money will solve all their problems. When I have occasion to ask a borrower how much they’re looking for and the reply is, “As much as I can get,” I cringe. This answer tells a potential lender that you haven’t really thought through your loan purpose. Your loan purpose should drive the answer to this question.</p>
<p>I disagree with the idea that you should borrow as much as you can at any opportunity you have because you never know when you won’t be able to borrow again. There are costs associated with borrowing that should be thoughtfully considered every time you seek borrowed funds. In fairness, I look at this process from a very conservative point of view. In my opinion, if the borrowed funds will drive increased returns on investments (“ROI”) or add value to the business, a small business loan could make a lot of sense—if not, I wouldn’t suggest borrowing. In other words, borrow what is required to fulfill your business need, but no more.</p>
<p>96 percent of the ETA survey respondents say the loan they secured enabled them to drive business growth. In my opinion, a loan purpose that will generate a positive ROI or growth of some kind is a good reason to consider a small business loan.</p>
<p>Determining the amount of money you need can also help you determine which lender to approach. Over the last several years many traditional lenders have moved upstream, looking for bigger businesses and bigger loans. Banks, for example, would rather lend $500,000 or $1 million than $50,000. It’s hard to blame them; they both carry about the same administrative and regulatory costs associated with underwriting the loan.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many lenders specialize in smaller loan amounts, which are specifically geared towards small businesses. According to the ETA survey, the average loan amount for an online business loan was $25,000. And the average number of times those business owners had borrowed over the past five years was three.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">3.</span> What does my credit profile look like?</strong> You credit profile really makes a difference—both your personal credit score and your business credit profile can dictate where you might find success looking for a loan. What’s more, one of the biggest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/whats-the-biggest-small-business-credit-misconception">small business credit misconceptions</a> is that many business owners are unaware of their business credit profile, meaning they don’t know what it says about their business’ creditworthiness. You need to focus on building both a strong personal credit score <em>and</em> business credit profile.</p>
<p>Although your personal credit score might not be the most accurate measure of how your business meets its obligations, most lenders will review your personal credit score when evaluating a business loan application. Some lenders weight your personal score differently than others. For instance, a credit score below 680 will make it difficult to qualify for a loan at the bank and a score below 650 will make it challenging to qualify for a small business loan.</p>
<p>There are some lenders that will accept lower scores, provided other metrics demonstrating a healthy business are in place. Nevertheless, most lenders look at your past credit behavior to make judgments and decisions about what you will likely do in the future—so maintaining a good personal credit score and <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/understanding-business-credit-and-5-ways-you-can-build-a-great-profile">building a strong business credit profile</a> should be a business priority for those seeking a small business loan.</p>
<p>Although an impeccable credit profile is no guarantee of financing, it will create more opportunities than a less-than-perfect profile. Another study, conducted by Nav (a free site offering business owners access to their personal credit scores and business credit profiles), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nav.com/insights/">the American Dream Gap Report</a> suggests that the businesses that regularly monitor their credit were 41 percent more likely to be approved for a loan.</p>
<p>Levi King, one of Nav’s co-founders and the CEO says, “I think it’s human nature to make a difference in the places where you’re really paying attention. Basically, attention drives behavior.”</p>
<p>Building a strong profile starts with getting familiar with it. And, an honest evaluation of your profile will help point you in the right direction when looking for a loan.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">4.</span> How quickly do I need the funds?</strong> Although this question is at the bottom of the list, it’s a very important question. Some loan purposes don’t allow the luxury of time to wait for several weeks to gain a loan approval. For example, ramping up your ability to serve a new customer contract might require additional capital within the next few days and waiting weeks for a small business loan could carry with it an opportunity cost that is too high.</p>
<p>63 percent of the ETA survey respondents listed speed of funding as the primary reason they chose the loan they did—which indicates the importance of this question and another reason why your first question should be, “What do I need the extra capital for?”</p>
<p>Now you’re ready to talk to a lender. You know what you need the capital for, you know how much you need, you know what your credit profile looks like, and you know how quickly you need the funds. With a better understanding of what you’re looking for to meet your business need and the type of lender you’re looking for, you’re better equipped to evaluate a potential lender based upon whether or not they’re a good fit for <em>your</em> business.</p>
<h3><strong>Before You Get a Small Business Loan, Ask Your Potential Lender:</strong></h3>
<p>Many small business owners leverage borrowed capital to fuel growth and fund other business initiatives. In addition to the right loan, finding the right lender can make the difference between successfully using a business loan to create value in your business; or contribute to putting your business’ viability at risk. Here are ten questions to help you determine whether or not a potential lender is a good fit for you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">1.</span> Do you lend to businesses in my industry?</strong> Many lenders specialize in working within specific industries or have identified industries they won’t work with. Asking this question early will help you avoid wasting time with a lender that won’t be able to help you—regardless of your creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Last year the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported the average small business owner spends 33 hours looking and applying for a loan. According to the ETA survey, the average small business owner in that group valued their time at $170 per hour. If that’s the case, that 33 hours can get very expensive very fast. Asking some of these questions early will help you save some of that very expensive time.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">2.</span> Do you offer a loan term that fits my business need?</strong> This is another important question. Because you’ve identified your loan purpose (your business need), you can determine whether or not you’re looking for a short-term or a long-term loan and will recognize a loan type that might not be a good fit.</p>
<p>In much the same way most consumers wouldn’t purchase a new car with a 30-year auto loan, you can quickly determine if the loan terms are right for your situation. There are lenders that offer exclusively either short-term or long-term loan options; so if you’re interviewing a lender who doesn’t offer the terms you’re looking for, you’ll recognize it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">3.</span> What are the interest rates and the total cost?</strong> There are a number of different pricing and comparison tools to help you assess and compare financing options. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is one way to compare loans, although it should be considered along with the total dollar cost of the loan – this is especially true when trying to compare loans of different duration.</p>
<p>The APR calculation includes all fees, so be sure you are comparing an APR to another full-APR and not just the annualized interest rate..</p>
<p>As noted above, along with asking about the interest rates and the fees, it’s also important to know what the total interest cost—or total dollar cost of the loan would be. For example, if you were to borrow $10,000 and your total payback was $11,500, your total dollar cost would be $1,500. The dollar cost can help a business determine affordability and easily compare cost to the expected ROI.</p>
<p>Your loan purpose will help inform this decision and is one reason why you want to ask yourself this question before you get in front of a loan officer at the bank or an online lender.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">4.</span> What will my payment schedule be? </strong>The advent of daily, weekly, and monthly periodic payments is a departure from a more traditional monthly payment approach. Nevertheless, many lenders (including online lenders) have adopted a more-frequent-than-monthly payment schedule for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is that it tends to smooth out the cash flow burden throughout the month rather than the traditional lumpy cash flow drain associated with a single payment every month.</p>
<p>If your potential lender requires a daily or weekly payment schedule, it’s important to make sure your business has consistent cash flow throughout the month. This type of payment schedule might not be a good choice for businesses that rely on a month-end influx of cash flow to maintain business operations or on infrequent inward deposits.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">5.</span> When is my first payment due?</strong> When making a monthly loan payment, it’s logical to assume your first payment will be due at the appropriate time of the month following when you take the loan. On the other hand, if you have a daily repayment schedule, your first payment will likely be due on the next business day after you’ve accepted the loan proceeds. This could be a concern to a business owner who wasn’t expecting the first payment to be due at that time, but can be accommodated if you are aware of that expectation—so be sure to ask. It’s the unexpected requirements that can cause consternation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">6.</span> How do I make my periodic payments?</strong> While there are some lenders who still accept a paper check sent by the borrower to the lender, many lenders (including online lenders) have turned to automatic debits via an ACH withdrawal from a business’ bank account. This is a common practice, which many business owners find very convenient.</p>
<p>This is an easy way for the lender to collect your loan payment in a timely manner—an obvious benefit to them. There are however, a few reasons why this could be considered good for the borrower:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each and every payment is made in a timely manner. This benefits the business because the single biggest influence to building a strong business credit profile is making each and every payment on time.</li>
<li>An ACH payment can save your business money. ElectronicPayments.org suggests it costs the average business owner $1.22 to write a paper check.</li>
<li>This type of electronic debit makes capital available to some borrowers who might not qualify within a more traditional payment model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you understand exactly what will be debited from you account with each periodic payment. Will it be a fixed amount or will it fluctuate depending upon what’s in your account. If you have a daily debit, you’ll want to confirm whether or not your account will be debited every day or every business day, so you can be prepared and ensure you have adequate funds in the business account to cover the debits.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to make sure you understand the process should there be a problem and there aren’t enough funds in your account when the periodic payment is due. A good lender should be willing to work with someone who proactively comes to them with an isolated problem. They want to see the loan process be successful as much as you do.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">7.</span> How long will the loan application process take?</strong> Depending upon the lender it could take anywhere from a day or two to several weeks—or even months. Depending upon your loan purpose and how quickly you would like the capital, there may be some lenders you weed out early in the process because their typical approval process just takes too long.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are lenders who are able to offer a quick decision, where if you are approved, you can have funds in your account sometimes as quickly as within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">8.</span> What is your Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating?</strong> This is not the only way to learn about how a company does business, but it can give you insight into how they resolve issues. Don’t be shy about visiting a review site or two, such as TrustPilot, in addition to the BBB to learn as much as you can about the lender.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">9.</span> May I speak to a few of your current and past customers?</strong> You will likely be talking to a selection of successful customers, but it might be a good idea to speak with a customer or two, review any customer success stories they may offer, look for customer testimonials, and even search online for reviews. Are most of the reviews positive? Do the same concerns seem to reappear? If something looks out of place, don’t hesitate to ask about it. And, if the lender can’t resolve your concerns, don’t be afraid to look someplace else.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0074ff;">10.</span> Do you report my credit history to the business credit bureaus?</strong> If they don’t report, your good credit behavior with them doesn’t do anything to help you build an even stronger business credit profile. There are some lenders, like merchant cash advance providers, that don’t. So don’t assume the lender you’re interviewing with does. This should be an important consideration when you’re looking for a small business loan.</p>
<p>You will discover there is likely more than one option available to you when you’re looking for a small business loan and some will likely be a better fit than others. As a result, you can look for a loan that will be a good option for your particular business situation.</p>
