<p>I don’t know if it’s really the changing of the seasons or just coincidence, but after over 30 years in small business, it always felt like when things got colder, we experienced problems with the building where we did business and those problems became more inconvenient to fix in the cold. And, that doesn’t include the extra things you just need to remember and be aware of as the seasons change. Here are three small business winter challenges to be prepared for and four other considerations that will help your small business seamlessly get through the winter.</p>
<p><strong>Be Prepared:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The roof:</strong> I spent 20 years working out of a 100-year-old home that had been converted into where we conducted business. The winters in Utah tended to encourage snow and ice to go through cycles of freezing and thawing all winter long, which puts a lot of stress on old roof seams, rain gutters, and other weak points on the roof. Nothing is worse than trying to get a leaky roof fixed when it’s covered with snow and freezing cold outside. Before the temperature drops and winter gets into full swing, have your roof inspected to make sure it will survive the the colder temperatures and wet weather—particularly if you haven’t given it any attention in a while.</li>
<li><strong>Plumbing:</strong> This is another challenge of working out of an older building, but it could be a problem for newer buildings too. If you’ve ever had to recover from a broken sewer line to the street, you know it’s not only a mess, but expensive to repair—and isn’t very fun to clean up. I don’t know what it is about January and February, but if we ever had a plumbing problem that resulted in a flood, it seemed to happen about that time. If you have to rooter your sewer line on a regular basis, consider it a red flag. It could be worth having a plumber scope your line to the street to make sure you don’t have any bulging pipes, roots, or other obstructions that could be the harbinger of a potential failure when the temperature drops, the ground is frozen, and it’s a pain to clean up the resulting flood. The cost of repairing a line to the street could be a few thousand dollars, so identifying a potential problem before it’s a crisis, will allow you to prepare financially before it happens; and maybe even take proactive steps before a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Pests:</strong> As the seasons change from summer to autumn, it’s a cue to everything that lives outside that it’s time to move inside. That includes spiders and other insects (we had to battle box elder bugs every year), field mice, or maybe even rats—which are not only pests, they could pose a health issue. Fortunately, there are services available that will come to your place of business on a regular basis to help you keep insects and other pests under control. They will also be able to help you identify where rodents like field mice or rats could gain entrance to your business so you can take proactive steps to make it a little more difficult for them to enter.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Things to Remember:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Snow Removal:</strong> You may or may not be responsible for snow removal in your parking lot, but the first big snow storm is not the time to be scrambling so your customers can do business with you. If you don’t happen to do business out of a strip mall and have a standalone business, it’s <em>not</em> too early to start looking for someone to plow snow in your parking lot. Depending on the size of your lot, it could cost a few hundred dollars every time the snow flies, but it’s well worth the cost to ensure your customers can access your business rain or shine.</li>
<li><strong>A Snow Shovel:</strong> If you’ve ever had to clear a couple of inches of snow from the entrance of your building with a broom, you’ll never forget to have a snow shovel in place again. Believe me, I know of what I speak. Even if the entrance to your business is small, a snow shovel is cheap insurance to keep the entryway free and clear. Don’t forget the ice-melt either. You certainly don’t want one of your customers (or employees) to slip and fall entering or exiting your place of work.</li>
<li><strong>The Furnace:</strong> Don’t wait until the first cold day of the season to see if your furnace is working. It’s well worth the few dollars it will likely cost to have a heating/air conditioning contractor inspect and service your furnace for the season. Both your employees and the customers that visit your place of business will thank you.</li>
<li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> If you do business in a place that sees a little snow, you understand that employees and customers can track in a little more mess than normal. To keep your place of business clean and in shape, you’ll likely not be able to wait until the end of the day before you clean up—regardless of whether or not you have a cleaning crew. Be prepared to sweep or mop up the floors near entryways to prevent damage from the wet and the salt. You might even opt for an additional rug or mat to help make entry to your business safe and slip-proof on the inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many small businesses are preparing for their busiest season right now. Taking a little time to ensure you’re ready for the winter might not guarantee you’ll avoid some of the challenges of the cold and snow, but it will help you be better prepared and able to navigate the challenges of the season.</p>
<p>What are some of the things you do to get ready for the snow and cold?</p>

<p>In many respects, a busy season is a healthy development. It’s a signal that your company is generating abundant revenues. Busy seasons may also signal a payoff for the hard work associated with establishing a business and getting the word out to prospective clients and customers. However, maximizing the benefits from a busy season requires more than providing services and products in real time. Anticipation and analysis are each essential to ensure that your company is prepared to properly handle busy seasons.</p>
<h4><b>Incorporate Predictive Analytics to Anticipate Demand</b></h4>
<p>Back in the day, attempting to anticipate demand involved more guesswork than anything else. At best, companies estimated their future inventory or service needs based on the outcome of previous seasons or accounting periods, coupled with applicable forecasts — such as anticipated severe weather or a rise in unemployment rates.</p>
<p>However, thanks to better data availability along with advances in hardware and software to analyze the data, guesswork has been largely replaced by systematic, estimation known as predictive analytics. Predictive analysis harnesses the information contained within historical data to anticipate future outcomes. No longer the exclusive domain of mathematicians and statisticians, predictive analytics has migrated into the mainstream of business operations. Companies that fail to incorporate predictive analytics into their business operations run the risk of being left behind by their competitors.</p>
<p>Along with minimizing fraud risk and evaluating customer creditworthiness, predictive analytics also represents a powerful tool for inventory management. Predictive analysis also improves the effectiveness of marketing campaigns through analyzing customer purchases. Identifying, cultivating and retaining the potentially most lucrative clients or customers is another excellent use of predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/blog/information-technology/top-predictive-analytics-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 predictive analytics tools</a> to help start your search for the tools that could be right for your small business.</p>
<h4><b>Review Company Past Performance</b></h4>
<p>Of course, the best predictive analysis system is only as good as its data. It is not enough to collect basic sales numbers. A proper review of your <a href="http://www.infoentrepreneurs.org/en/guides/review-your-business-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company’s past performance</a> can address many questions, some of the most important of which are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the company effectively reaching its core customers? If not, should there be a reconsideration of the company’s marketing techniques — or its core customers?</li>
<li>How did the company perform in comparison to comparable competitors? Are companies of similar available capacity in products and/or services even busier during busy seasons? If so, how do they accommodate increased demand?</li>
<li>Has the busy season generated a potential for customers who will return during subsequent busy seasons or even during slow season?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Did the company adequately meet its customers’ needs and/or desires during the busy season? Selling out of a hot item is not a positive outcome if too many customers walk away from an establishment empty handed.</li>
<li>Was the busy season evenly distributed among products or services? If not, which products or services lagged?</li>
<li>Was your staff or team up to the task of handling the busy season? If not, was the problem due to inadequate staff numbers, poorly trained staff or staff whose qualifications were simply not up to the task?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers to these and related questions form the foundation of an solid Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis the data from a well-executed SWOT analysis along with predictive analytics provides an excellent basis for analyzing a past busy season as well as preparing for upcoming busy seasons.</p>
<h4><b>Utilize Business Loans and Financing to Fund Essential Investments</b></h4>
<p>One possible outcome from a <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/swot-analysis-tools-can-help-small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWOT analysis</a> and predictive analytics report is that additional investment is needed to finance essential equipment, inventory or personnel. Especially in very competitive markets or industry sectors, failure to keep up with current equipment and inventory, software or marketing techniques can result in a company being labeled as unresponsive, out-of-touch or outdated.</p>
<p>However, financing essential investments can be challenging. Unless your company is flush with cash, borrowing is called for. There are a number of options for business borrowing, and no one-size-fits-all solution. In fact, depending on size, industry or other factors, companies may need to consider a combination of options to obtain necessary funds from borrowing. A few of the <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/07/how-to-finance-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more common options</a> for small and medium-sized companies are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bank and Credit Union Loans &#8211;</b> Although the financial crisis has yielded to an ongoing recovery, banks have retained stringent standards for granting loans, especially to startups, entrepreneurs or small businesses. Companies with business plans have the best chance of securing bank loans, especially from community banks. Credit unions may also be more lenient, especially with long-time customers.</li>
<li><b>Small Business Administration (SBA) &#8211;</b> <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/sba-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA loans</a> carry federal guarantees, which make it easier for businesses to qualify. However, a solid business plan is still necessary.</li>
<li><b>Invoice Factoring &#8211;</b> For companies that process payments through invoicing, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/need-know-invoice-factoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factoring</a> represents one of the most readily available forms of funding. With invoice factoring, companies yield a percentage of their paid invoice to the invoice factoring provider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Micro Loans &#8211;</b> Credit challenged business borrowers can often obtain small loans (under $35,000) from <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/what-are-micro-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonprofit micro lenders</a>. Formerly associated with enterprises in the developing world, micro-loans are increasingly available in the United States.</li>
<li><b>Crowdfunding &#8211;</b> Crowdfunding isn’t limited to the greatest new gadget or aspiring artist attempting to fund an album. Small companies and startups also turn to crowdfunding. However, many crowdfunding campaigns fall short of their goals.</li>
<li><b>Online Lenders –</b> Many <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/online-applications-small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online lenders</a>, like OnDeck, offer loans for a variety of loan purposes and regularly work with small business owners to fuel growth opportunities or fund other business initiatives. Applications are usually very simple and business borrowers can have an answer that same day and potentially the funds to work with within 24-48 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to maximizing the benefits of a busy season is through proactive planning rather than reactive regrouping. Using tools such as predictive analytics, SWOT and judicious financial investments can ensure that your company is ready not only to meet the demand of a busy season, but to reap maximum profits now and in the future.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, I interviewed the owner of an auto-body shop in Michigan. I know <em>nothing</em> about cars. Since I grew up in New Jersey and lived in Manhattan without a car after that, I didn’t even know how to pump gas until I was in my mid-20s! Suffice it to say, I had a lot of questions for this busy business owner. One of the interesting industry details I learned was in Michigan, the busy season for a mechanic is in the spring when people are willing to start repairing the damage the long winter inflicted on their cars. Maybe this isn’t shocking to you, but it completely surprised me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a business owner you know exactly when your customers are rushing your door and here are <strong>6 ideas</strong> to take full advantage of your busy season.</span></p>
<h4><b>Grow your email list: </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now’s the time to take advantage of the traffic your business is seeing. Ask customers to share their email and add them to your list. You may be surprised to learn that email marketing is one of the cheapest, simplest, and most successful forms of marketing around, which makes it a great tool for small business owners. Don’t forget there are </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/small-business-best-practices-email-marketing"><span style="font-weight: 400">laws and best practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> surrounding email marketing, so make sure you’re following them.</span></p>
<h4><b>Social sharing:</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter if you sell a physical product or an intangible service happy customers sharing photos and videos on social media is always good for business. You know which sites your customers live on, so create a hashtag, create a contest or use one of your creative ideas to get your customers to interact with you on social. One store I was in recently set up a cardboard cutout of an instagram post on an easel and customers were lining up to take pictures in it. It was a super inexpensive, easy win.</span></p>
<h4><b>Encourage reviews:</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the idea that you can’t control what people will say publicly about your business may be terrifying, the bottom line is that </span><a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/how-to-get-happy-customers-to-write-you-online-reviews"><span style="font-weight: 400">online reviews matter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The best way to ensure a positive to review is to treat every customer (no matter how difficult) with respect and to address negative experiences as soon as they happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asking customers to leave reviews on specific sites is a standard practice, just remember you can’t incentivise customers to leave a positive review. Choose the review sites that work best for your business and double down on collecting reviews while you have more customers coming through the door.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Note: In the inevitable case when you receive a negative review, your response is almost more important than the review itself. Make sure to address the issue and invite them back to try your business again.</span></em></p>
<h4><b>Team up with other local businesses:</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A local exercise studio in my town  is always partnering with other local businesses that have similar audiences. They often allow local apparel shops, restaurants, beauty salons, and even the frozen yogurt shop down the street (that one’s a little mean) to set up a table or put out postcards in the reception area. This is so smart because when I walk around our town, I see their promotion cards all over the place from all the businesses they’ve partnered up with. For small, local businesses working together is better than working alone.</span></p>
<h4><b>Offer repeat  customer perks:</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may not think that your busy season is the time to give discounts to your repeat customers, it seems more like a slow season activity. However, getting your customers into the habit of frequenting your business during the busy season will only encourage their return when it slows down. You can use punch cards, postcards, social check-ins or anything else you can think of as proof. Giving away little freebies, like a free drink, or small extra bit of service, or even $5 off their next purchase gives customers a positive feeling toward your business and keeps them coming back for more.</span></p>
<h4><b>Motivate your staff: </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If your business depends on a staff to make sales, the motivation to put in extra effort can wane when it’s not too difficult for them to make a sale. Keep your employees pumped up by having contests, prizes, or other fun activities to push them to double down on the busy season with you and propel your sales into the stratosphere.</span></p>
