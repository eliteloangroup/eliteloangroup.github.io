<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you’re beginning your research into financing for your business, there are a lot of items you need to consider. The most common question is ‘what type of loan should I get?’ There’s a myth out in the business world that it’s best to get the most amount of money for the longest payback period possible you can qualify for. This advice is not only misleading, but it can cause many businesses more hard than good. The most critical issue you need to sort out is, what exactly will you use the money for? And how long will it take to see any ROI from the money borrowed? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Short-term loans (less than 24-month terms) often seem a little scarier just by looking at the basic numbers than a longer-term loan, but they can be the right choice if your business will see the ROI from the monies borrowed within that term. It doesn’t make sense to take a five-year term on inventory you’ll sell (and see returns on) in 6 months.</span></p>

			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> There are numerous options to the traditional five- or ten-year business loan today.

<p>When most people think of a small business loan, they think of the traditional five- or 10-year term loans available from the bank, the credit union, or an SBA-guaranteed loan. When borrowing to meet needs like purchasing expensive, heavy equipment, expanding into a new location, or building a new warehouse, a longer-term loan can be a good fit because the longer term allows the borrower to reduce the amount of the periodic payment over the course of the loan and better match to the productive term of the equipment. Nevertheless, there are some loan purposes where the longer-terms of these more traditional small business loans might not be the best fit. In those situations, short-term business loans can be a better fit.</p>

<p>Fortunately for small businesses, their local bank is not the only place to borrow, there are loan options available for a variety of loan purposes, and loans with shorter terms are available to meet the financing needs of shorter-term projects.</p>
<p><strong>When Should a Business Consider Short-Term Business Loans?</strong></p>
<p>The first question any business should ask before it borrows is, “What is the loan purpose?” This will help determine how much capital they need to borrow, what loan terms make the most sense (short-term vs. long-term), and even where they might look to secure the funding.</p>
<p>Depending upon the loan purpose, some small business borrowers chose a shorter-term loan to minimize the total dollar cost of the loan. According to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/ETA_Infographic6.pdf">survey</a> commissioned by the Electronic Transactions Association, 57 percent of small businesses would choose a shorter-term loan in order to minimize the total fees and expenses when presented with a short-term investment opportunity. Because APR does not represent the total dollar cost of a loan, this was true even if the shorter-term loan included a higher APR than the longer-term option.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tg5QbMYJcsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The two most identified loan purposes of the small businesses participating in the survey were to purchase equipment (54 percent) or to purchase inventory (51 percent)—both purchases tend to be very total dollar cost sensitive. What’s more, these small businesses were anticipating a 5X return for every dollar they borrowed, making the total dollar cost of the loan a key consideration for them.</p>
<p>Some popular reasons for considering a short-term business loan might include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Project start-up costs:</strong> There are times when ramping up a new project requires upfront costs that might exceed a business’ ability to cover with cash flow, but will be recouped in 60 or 90 days as their customer(s) pay their invoices. In that case, the ability to get in and out of the financing quickly at a lower total dollar cost could make more sense than making payments on a longer-term loan for several years.</li>
<li><strong>Bridging a seasonal cash flow gap:</strong> Many seasonal businesses sometimes borrow to meet short-lived cash flow demands during lulls that exist between their busy seasons to cover expenses during the down time. Doing so requires the business ensure that it has sufficient cash flow during that slow period to make the larger periodic payments often associated with a short-term loan.</li>
<li><strong>Purchasing quick-turnaround inventory at a discount:</strong> A short-term loan could be a good opportunity for <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/inventory-loans">purchasing inventory</a> at a discount that will turn quickly and allow the business to capture additional profits.</li>
<li><strong>Cover the costs of emergency repairs of critical equipment:</strong> When equipment necessary to the operation of your business fails, a short-term small business loan can help get operations moving again without a four-year or longer loan obligation.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, many times, short-term business loans may come with faster approval rates than more traditional long-term financing at the bank – which helps when time is of the essence.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does Loan Purpose Matter?</strong></p>
<p>In the same way technology companies like Expedia, Airbnb, and Kayak are changing the way we plan a vacation, companies like Zillow are changing the way we buy a house, companies like Uber are changing the way we hail a cab, and companies like Amazon are changing the way we buy just about anything, technology has changed the way many small businesses get a small business loan. One of the ways they’re doing it is by focusing on specific loan types, loan terms, and other criteria that match particular business use cases.</p>
<p>Most people would never buy a new car with a 30-year auto loan; and some small business financing options may be better suited to meet shorter-term business needs. For example, the type of loan a business would need to purchase inventory at a discount could be very different from financing the construction of a new warehouse or the purchase of a new location for a growing restaurant. Sometimes it might not make sense to borrow for several years when the value of the asset you’re borrowing for has a much shorter lifespan or productive term.</p>
<p>When loan term drives the borrowing decision, it enables businesses to answer some important questions like:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much capital do I really need to borrow?</li>
<li>Is there a lender that specializes in the type of loan I need?</li>
<li>What loan term makes the most sense?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Using a short-term business loans to build your business credit profile</strong></p>
<p>A short-term business loan can also be a tool to help a business create a stronger business credit profile. Unlike some other lenders, OnDeck reports your business credit history with us to a number of business credit bureaus; so long as you make timely payments, that positive credit history helps your business build a strong profile. This can be particularly valuable for younger businesses as it has the potential to help create additional small business loan options down the road.</p>
<p>Since 2007, <a target="_blank" href="https://online.ondeck.com/">OnDeck</a> has helped over 80,000 small business owners access over $8 billion in loans with terms from three months to 36 months.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What is short-term business financing?</b></span></h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><b>Short-Term business financing includes financing with terms less </b><b>than 24 months. </b></h4>
<p>Whether it’s a term loan or a line of credit, the best use case for a short-term loan is for projects where the business need has a clear short-term ROI.</p>
<p>Traditional lenders, such as banks, do not typically offer short-term <span style="font-weight: 400">small business loans. Online lenders, like OnDeck, offer short-term </span><span style="font-weight: 400">loans and lines of credit to meet a variety of small business use </span><span style="font-weight: 400">cases. Some business owners, especially those with long-standing </span><span style="font-weight: 400">relationships with their banks, sometimes have questions about </span><span style="font-weight: 400">short-term loans.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What business needs are a good fit for short-term financing?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first question you should ask yourself when you begin the process of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">securing financing for your business is: what is your business need? Your </span><span style="font-weight: 400">answer to this question will determine what type of financing and loan </span><span style="font-weight: 400">term is appropriate for your business. Do you need the funds quickly? Do </span><span style="font-weight: 400">you need the funds for a project that will capture additional ROI in a short </span><span style="font-weight: 400">period of time? Different types of financing are appropriate for different </span><span style="font-weight: 400">business needs.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169794 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=1616%2C530&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1616" height="530" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?w=1616&amp;ssl=1 1616w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Examples of business needs for short-term financing to fuel growth <span style="font-weight: 400">or increase ROI are: a physical expansion or renovation, hiring a new </span><span style="font-weight: 400">employee, buying inventory quickly, or purchasing equipment. These and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">similar initiatives can help your business growth long-term, and generally </span><span style="font-weight: 400">provide realized gains fairly quickly. The loan term should match the useful </span><span style="font-weight: 400">life of the asset just as you wouldn’t take a 30-year auto loan for your car, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">even if the payments were smaller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What costs make sense? APR vs. Cents on the Dollar</b></span></h2>
<p>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is only one way to compare your financing <span style="font-weight: 400">options. APR represents the total interest cost, including fees, as an annualized rate which may appear higher than the actual overall cost of a short term loan. In many cases, the APR of a short-term loan can be much higher than the APR for a longer-term loan. But when you consider other factors, such as total cost of the loan and your business need, you can see a short-term loan could be a better fit for your business. As you see in the example below, the shorter-term loan has a higher APR, but a lower overall cost than the longer term loan with the lower APR.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>Let’s run some numbers to illustrate the point.</i></b></span></h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169795 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=1666%2C896&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1666" height="896" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?w=1666&amp;ssl=1 1666w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C413&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C551&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>It really depends on the term length of your financing:</i></b></span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169796" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=1608%2C674&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1608" height="674" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?w=1608&amp;ssl=1 1608w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=768%2C322&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=1024%2C429&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1608px) 100vw, 1608px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>Another metric to consider is the overlap between your </i></b><b><i>periodic payments and the returns on your investment.</i></b></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For example:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> If you are planning to use your loan to make an equipment purchase, then the equipment you buy might start generating</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">returns immediately. In that case, consider comparing your daily or weekly payment on the loan to the daily or weekly income your investment will generate. That difference represents your net gain from the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the short-run</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Calculating ROI</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Time Is Money:</strong></span> Traditional lenders, like banks, can take weeks to process your business loan application and for you to receive the funds. Short-term online lenders, often have an answer to your loan application in under an hour and funds in your account as quickly as the next business day. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports it takes the average small business owner 33 hours to apply for a loan at the bank.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Considering ROI When You Borrow</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For short-term loans with a defined ROI target, APR might not be as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">important a metric as the total cost of the loan relative to the return on </span><span style="font-weight: 400">investment.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some business owners are concerned the with higher periodic payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400">often associated with a short-term loan. If your business has the cash flow to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">sustain the payments, the lower total dollar cost of capital can be cheaper, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the long run, with a short-term loan. Even if the long-term loan has a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">lower periodic payment or a lower APR.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>EXAMPLE: <span style="color: #000082">How Can a Short-Term Loan Affect My Cash Flow?</span></b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>A laundromat buys 10 new washing machines.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the day they install the new machines, they generate $540 per day ($3 per cycle,180 cycles per day). If they bought the machines with a 6-month loan for $10,000 at 1.19 Cents on the Dollar (CoD), their daily payment would be $95/day. So, over the short-term, their net gain would be $540-$95 (minus the cost of the water and electricity to run the machines).</span></p>

<p>Once they’ve made all 126 payments they get to keep all $540 (minus utilities) for the remaining lifetime of the machines. That might be more appealing to some business owners than a loan with a longer payback, because they might be willing to pay more in the short-term in exchange for a greater ROI, faster.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>What do I need the money for?</b></span></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>How quickly do I need the money?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you need the money tomorrow, this week, or next month? The time frame in which you need the funds can drastically cut or shape the options that work for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>What types of financing can I qualify for?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your personal credit score, business credit profile, cash flow, time in business, annual revenue, and several other factors are all considered by lenders to determine the funds and terms you will qualify for. Know the minimum requirements for each lender before you put in an application. That way, you won’t waste your time applying with lenders that won’t work with your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>Do I have all the information I need to make a decision?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The simplest way to know you’re getting the best financing for your business is to have all of the information beforehand. Do your research, so you spend your time applying with lenders who will lend to you and will meet your business needs.</span></p>
