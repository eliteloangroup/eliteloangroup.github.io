<p>I don’t think I’m alone when I suggest, that like many small business owners, I didn’t jump into business ownership because I was really excited about small business bookkeeping or accounting. I knew it was part of the deal, but it wasn’t the part of business ownership I was the most jazzed about. Nevertheless, there are important small business financial metrics every business owner needs to know.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that one of my best friends is a CPA and was regularly offering me accounting advice (some of which I actually listened to), like many business owners I know, I thought I had a better handle on the important small business financial metrics  than I really did. Looking back, I recognize that with a better understanding of what I didn’t know at the time, my life would probably have been easier.</p>
<p>Understanding your business’ financial metrics, and what those numbers are telling you, is critical to running a successful business, knowing whether or not your business is profitable, or waking up one day to find out you’re on the slow march to insolvency and going <em>out</em> of business. There are a handful of metrics I think every business owner should be familiar with, but I’ll preface my suggestions with the following disclaimer:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<h5>“I’m not an accountant and although I believe, from my personal experience, that these are some of the more important metrics every business owner needs to be familiar with, you should also speak with your accountant or a trusted financial advisor to see if there are any other metrics he or she feels are more important for your business and get their perspective on what these metrics mean and how you should measure them.”</h5>		</div>
		
<p>In addition to being tools to help you successfully run your business, I once spoke with a lender who said, “If I can tell more about a business by looking at the financial numbers than the business owner, I’m not likely to offer them a loan.” In that sense, having a thorough understanding of what your financial reports are telling you also instills confidence in those that work for you, those that offer you credit, or anyone who otherwise helps you to succeed.</p>
<h4><strong>5 Important Small Business Financial Metrics You Need to Understand</strong></h4>
<p>Most of these metrics are pretty straightforward and logical, but hopefully I’ll be able to add something based upon my experience as a small business owner and shed some light on how I monitored these metrics in my business.</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ol><li><strong>Income:</strong> Without business income, or revenue, nothing else happens. Nobody gets paid. Products don’t get delivered. Supplies can’t be purchased. Without revenue, businesses can’t sustain operations. In my opinion, this is one of the first metrics you need to be intimate with. I tracked this number daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually so I could compare how I was doing today with how my business was doing last year, month, week, etc.<br /><br />This is an important number to a lender, for example. Because one of the things they are trying to evaluate when they review your loan application is whether or not you have the income to make any periodic payments associated with a potential small business loan, without revenue, your business’ ability to service debt will be considered questionable.<br />Fortunately, this is a fairly easy number to capture. What are your total sales?<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Expenses:</strong> There are several ways to categorize your expenses, and your accountant can help you with those; but ultimately, you want to know what it costs to do business and whether or not your business income is sufficient to meet those business expenses. It’s the difference between your income and expenses that determine if your business is profitable or not. After all, profits should be one of the primary goals of going into business for yourself.<br /><br />Granted, there are some businesses today (particularly in the tech space) that forego profits in the beginning and focus more on growth. To do this, they rely on investor income, rather than profits, to fuel the fire of growth before they become profitable. That’s how companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Uber became household names. These investors forecasted that their returns would be exponentially greater by investing today for a potential payout down the road. If your small business has the potential to grow and scale profits with the infusion of capital, you are probably considering this, but most small business owners need to focus on selling their goods or services for more than it costs to produce them so they can generate profits.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> Inadequate cash flow has rung the death knell for many small businesses over the years. If you’ve ever heard the term, “Cash flow is king,” this is what it’s talking about. It’s not enough to simply have money in your business checking account at the end of the month; you need to understand your Cash Flow Metric.<br /><br />You calculate this metric by dividing your assets and your liabilities. This is an important enough metric, that if you’re unsure about how to define assets and liabilities, I encourage you to speak with your accountant to make sure you’re clear on the definitions. The ideal goal for this metric is 2:1, or twice as many assets as liabilities. Understandably, this 2:1 goal is challenging for many businesses to maintain, but anything below 1:1 should be a big red flag that your business doesn’t have adequate cash flow to maintain operations.<br /><br />This can be an important metric. For example, it should be an important part of consideration when looking at a potential small business loan. Because the loan payment becomes a liability, if those payments pull your metric down below 1:1, it could indicate that you are borrowing your way into trouble. Having a handle on your cash flow metric is critical to small business success.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Accounts Receivable Aging:</strong> This is an important metric that you can’t afford to ignore. How long does it take your customers, to whom you offer credit terms, to pay their invoices? If you offer 30-day terms, do they consistently pay in 30 days or do they sometimes go 45 or 60 days.<br /><br />In my business, after 45 days I started to lose whatever profit was in an invoice and after 65 days my profits were entirely gone because of the impact it had on my cash flow. What’s more, for every day over 40 days an invoice was late, it became more difficult to collect. (These timeframes might not apply to your particular business, but it’s worth investigating your situation to determine these numbers for your business.)<br /><br />Needless to say, I worked very hard to ensure that my customers stayed current, and even encouraged them to pay early by offering them a discount on their invoice if they paid within 10 days. Those that took advantage of the discount helped my business by giving me 20 extra days to use that income to increase profits—in other words, the discount was worth it to me.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Accounts Payable Aging:</strong> Another number you should know is the average number of days it takes you to meet your business’ financial obligations. If you’re able to effectively manage your Accounts Receivable, your cash flow, and your income, you should be able to keep your accounts payable current and maybe even take advantage of the prompt payment terms you’re suppliers likely offer you.<br /><br />I know of several small business owners who save enough money by paying their suppliers early and taking the offered discount that they take a big chunk out of payroll every month with the savings. What’s more, if you’re looking at your income and expenses, the ability to take that discount may even positively impact your profitability.<br /><br />As a business looking for borrowed capital, the single most important thing you can do to positively impact your business credit rating and increase the options you’ll have when it comes time to borrow is staying current with your business credit obligations. That includes you utility bills, your business lease, your credit relationships with vendors, and any other business credit obligation you may have.</li></ol>		</div>
		
<p>In my opinion, it’s important to have a handle on these five metrics to run a successful business. You may even want to dive a little deeper into one or two of them. For example, you can categorize income streams or identify particular classes of expenses that might make it easier to understand and control. Your accountant or CPA can help you identify the metrics that will give you the most insight into your business.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to ask him or her questions if there are terms or formulae you are unfamiliar with. You accountant should be able to explain them in terms you’ll understand. One of the big mistakes I made as a business owner was treating my accountant as a transactional relationship, rather than a consultative relationship that had the potential of helping me more easily grow my business. In hindsight, I wish I had leveraged that relationship more to my advantage.</p>
<p>Are there any metrics you think I might have missed?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff">Evaluate These Metrics for Your Small Business Growth</span></h1>
<p>There are many areas of metrics small business owners can use to measure their business. At OnDeck, <strong>to say we’re metrics obsessed is an understatement</strong>. This applies to how we approach our business in general as well as in each department from marketing, sales, website development, and how we take care of our customers. Before every decision we make big and small, we evaluate our past performance. My colleagues and I are always asking questions to evaluate our performance and our impact. We ask questions like: Did I accomplish the goals I set out to, in every increment (monthly, quarterly, etc.)? Did I set the right goals? How can I do this differently to get a better result? We do this to make sure we’re<strong> giving our customers exactly what they need</strong> to make the right decision about financing for their business. Here are some metrics for small business success you should keep track of.</p>
<p>I also know small business owners and their businesses don&#8217;t have the time, bandwidth or budget to evaluate every decision in depth, all of the time. Over the course of the month, we focused on several areas that we, as a team, think small businesses could benefit from evaluating and keeping track of the most.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a">Your Financial Metrics:</span></h2>
<p>Finances are the core of every business. Without your financials in order, your business can not run at the top of its game. Like everything in life, the more you know about a topic, the more you can do with it. When it comes to your financials; you want to be able to make incremental changes for the better, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/financial-metrics-every-small-business-owner-needs-to-know?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=evaluateyourbusiness&amp;utm_content=article1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catch mistakes before they become a problem</a></span>. I joke with my husband, who owns a small business, that he prefers to hang out with his business bank account more than with me. (Not actually true, but it’s a close second.) A small business owner should be keenly aware of all the numbers, whether or not you feel like the numbers are your strong suit.</p>
<p>You should be consistently looking at your <strong>income, expenses, cash flow, accounts receivable, and accounts payable</strong>. These areas are the base of your business finances, and you should know them intimately. Make it a point to talk with your accountant or bookkeeper to stay informed. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The more you know, the better off your business will be.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a">Your Business Plan:</span></h2>
<p>You develop a business plan at the onset of most businesses. You set benchmarks, you make financial projections, and you state a clear, concise idea of what your business will do. If you are evaluating your business goals every few months, you’ll notice if your business is doing what it needs to do. But what happens when you look back, and your initial plan for your business no longer fits the need of the market, the space is too crowded, or you’re not hitting your marks? It doesn’t always mean that you need to shutter your doors, <strong>sometimes all you need to do is look at your business from another perspective and pivot</strong>. Pivoting is not a negative action, and there is no point in the calendar year that can tell you when to do it, but many businesses evaluate their goals at the end of a quarter, mid-year, or year-end. This keeps you and your business on track and gives you the opportunity to make changes before it’s too late.</p>
<p>Our guest writer in July, Lisa Hendrickson CEO of Spark City, a small business consultancy developed her “<span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/evalutate-these-metrics-for-small-business-success" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 Rs System</a></span>” to keep business owners moving toward what they really want to achieve. Review. Recalibrate. Rip. Recommit. Revive. Follow this system, and you’ll get your business goals back on the right track as soon as possible.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a">Your Social Media Marketing:</span></h2>
<p>You might be thinking of rolling your eyes. Every single article you’ve read about small business growth, marketing, or any other aspect somehow pulls in social media into the conversation; I know, I do it all the time. <strong>You want to read an article that tells you which platform to be on and how often to post and that is not going to happen.</strong> The reason is that every business is different, even if you have a similar target market and a similar product as a competitor, what works for one company doesn&#8217;t always work for another. So there won’t be a general article on social media telling you exactly what to do, but we can tell you what you should keep an eye on to <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/increase-bottom-line-evaluate-online-presence?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=evaluateyourbusiness&amp;utm_content=article4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimize your impact on social media</a></span>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><strong>First,</strong></span> you need to find the right channel for you. Keep an eye on the platforms you choose to work with and go from there. Remember it’s better to build up slowly than jumping the gun on platforms that waste your time and money. <span style="color: #000082"><strong>2.</strong></span> Set up your social media to work for you. Each platform is different, so work with the intricacies of the platforms you’re on, and be responsive to your audience. Listening is a huge part of social media. Stop focusing on what you’re going to post this week or next and see what your followers are saying about you and about your competitors. Use that information to inform your posts. <strong><span style="color: #000082">3.</span></strong> Automate what you can. You’re busy, don’t let your social media channels suffer from your busy schedule. Spend a little bit of time at the beginning of the week setting it up, like you would any other task and go from there. <span style="color: #000082"><strong>4</strong></span>. Use your email lists to target the right customers. <span style="color: #000082"><strong>5.</strong></span> Lead generation. Use a combination of content and your social platforms to generate leads for your business. This requires a bit of work, but don’t forget how powerful social media can be for your business growth.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a">Your Online Presence:</span></h2>
<p>As a business owner, you know that you need to be online to reach as many potential customers as possible. But how do you know if you’re doing it right? All it takes is a bit of planning and some forethought. Plan to evaluate <strong>your website, social media, online marketing and SEO</strong> at regular intervals as you do with the other area of your business. <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/increase-bottom-line-evaluate-online-presence?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=evaluateyourbusiness&amp;utm_content=article4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are a lot of aspects of your online presence to evaluate</a></span>, from checking to see if your website works on mobile devices, to seeing if your business comes up on the Google searches you want to show up for. Take any learnings and apply them to strengthen your business online.</p>
<p>There will always be new areas of your business to check and test, but if you <strong>make evaluation a part of your routine business maintenance</strong>, you’ll be able to see any issues are creeping up and prevent them from becoming bigger problems.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
