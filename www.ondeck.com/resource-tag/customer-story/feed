								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sandy Stroehmann is the owner of <a target="_blank" href="https://elixirmindbodymassage.com/">Elixir Mind Body Massage</a>, a spa and wellness center in Downtown Denver. Sandy spoke with us about her spa, the search for financing, and how she built a profitable business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your background and how you started your business.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a serial entrepreneur all my life. I love business and I have always known I wanted to be in business for myself.</p>
<p>The idea around my business was an interesting process. I was living in North Carolina, and I was the executive director of a non-profit children&#8217;s health museum. If you’ve worked for a non-profit, you know it can be stressful. To relieve the stress, I went for massages. This was long before massage was widely available. “You know, this is a great idea. I should do something like this someday, but a little bit differently.&#8221; I think the idea of a beautiful space and a variety of services adds to stress relief, pain relief, that kind of thing. I just wanted to tweak it.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, I was living back East. Got a divorce, moved back home. And I started another company, and it was a good company. But I didn&#8217;t feel like I was making a difference, and in the back of my head, I kept getting this feeling, like, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you doing what you really want to do? Why aren&#8217;t you giving back?&#8221; So, I put together a business plan, got the funding together, and 18 months later, we opened Elixir. We&#8217;ve been open since June of 2007, and this will be our 12th year.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about being a small business owner, and specifically in this industry?</strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are a special breed. We absolutely love to create, and we have this dream, and we want to see it created, and evolve, and become something that is not just for us, but for everybody else.</p>
<p>I work with the most compassionate people, and we make a difference every day. People come here to see us because they&#8217;re in pain, they&#8217;re stressed, or they&#8217;re celebrating something. Being in an industry where we give back, it&#8217;s almost like the pebble in the water, where you can have an impact on one person, but that goodness ripples out to others. These kinds of things are really important to me, and I feel like we&#8217;re making a difference.</p>
<p><strong>What has been some of the biggest challenges as a small business owner? </strong></p>
<p>There have been several challenges, and they’re different depending on where we are in the business cycle. For us, kind of a constant is never having enough staff. We&#8217;ve got this great company, and we have a great product; however, we&#8217;re very picky about the people we bring on board. So, having hiring, training, retaining, that has always been a harder thing for me to do, and to do well. But it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve worked on, and we&#8217;ve got a great staff.</p>
<p><strong>In your business, you need to make sure your employees are efficient, so you can serve your guests in a timely manner. How do you go about doing this?</strong></p>
<p>We do a lot of training here, and education is a big part of who we are, both for our guests and our employees. We spend a great deal of time, anywhere from nine months to a year, to get all our service providers up to speed on our menu and services. We do a lot of training at the front desk as well, because it&#8217;s important that our front desk can do consultations, and really find out what works for our guests.</p>
<p>We have staff meetings every six weeks, which usually include a lot of training. There is also a regularly monthly session. We&#8217;re constantly doing evaluations with new employees. We have 30, 60, and 90-day evaluations where we&#8217;re checking in, coaching, and doing those things to bring them up to our standards of excellence.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What sources of capital did you look into?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, it was easy. It was a good economy, I had a great credit score, and I was able to secure a lot of funding.</p>
<p>That funding pretty much dried up once we had 2008 hit. We had a line of credit with some of the bigger banks, and rather than continue to allow us to take the line of credit, they just canceled it and it turned it into a loan. We no longer had access to additional capital, and it made things very difficult. The big banks really didn&#8217;t want to give any funding anymore, and I think a lot of small businesses ran into that.</p>
<p>Luckily, we were in a position where we had always positioned ourselves as more wellness, as opposed to a luxury, like many spas. When people were cutting back during the downturn in the economy, they were still coming here because they knew their health really mattered. So, we were doing well, but we didn&#8217;t have access to funding. When I ran into OnDeck, it was a godsend, because they actually wanted to work with me. And made it easy to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>So why did you choose OnDeck initially, and why have you come back?</strong></p>
<p>OnDeck was more small business friendly. They were a little more expensive, but they were also so easy to work with, and the ability to get funds when I needed them enabled us to continue our business without any interruption.</p>
<p>I’ve come back to OnDeck for several reasons. They served me very well. Their customer service is exceptional. They also support the businesses that take loans from them. Their employees come to Elixir routinely. I always thought and appreciated the fact that they supported us that way. They also listen to their customers. I’ve been on customer forums at their offices here in Denver. And they would ask, &#8220;What things are we doing right, what kind of things do we need to be doing better?&#8221; And one of the things that I had mentioned was lines of credit are much better for me than loans. I rarely have the need for a loan, but sometimes I&#8217;ll need a quick infusion of cash that we can pay off quickly, where I don&#8217;t have a lot of interest expense. And next thing I knew, they had a line of credit available as part of their products.</p>
<p><strong>How have you used the money to grow your business?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve used it to hire staff, we&#8217;ve used it to create brand-new services, like our facials. We brought in new inventory. When we do training, when you&#8217;re hiring and spending all this money, you must do that for recruiting and everything, as well. We&#8217;ve also used it to create our own brand. Right now, we&#8217;re using it to rebrand and repackage our private label. So, all these things have helped to really increase not only the efficacy of our company, and the way that we serve our guests, but it&#8217;s also allowed us to expand and really move into some areas that have made us much more profitable.</p>
<p><strong>What have been some measurable results on your ROI? </strong></p>
<p>I have been able to hire two new managers to really help me more with the day-to-day operations, so I can spend more time working on the business instead of always working in it. I still work in the business, because I love it and I love our clients. But I do need to step back and work on the business, so that&#8217;s been really great. We&#8217;ve also hired a number of new staff. We have two new aestheticians. We&#8217;re constantly hiring new therapists. We&#8217;ve also added new equipment. We had to buy new equipment for our aesthetics and our facial room. We&#8217;ve increased our inventory. And of course, we&#8217;ve added our private label line and our repackaging that.</p>
<p><strong>How has flexible financing helped you achieve your goals?</strong></p>
<p>Anybody that has run a small business knows, it&#8217;s nice that you&#8217;re smaller, because you can turn on a dime. If you run across an opportunity, if you have an opportunity to do something different and you need fast cash to take advantage of that, you can. If an opportunity presents itself, I can jump on it, and I have. It also helps with unexpected expenses. These are the things that the flexibility allows me, and within a day, I have the financing I need to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></p>
<p>Evolution. We&#8217;ve seen so many changes in the last 12 years; we added facials in 2018 because so many of our clients were asking for that service, and it has been exciting to see the change and the different clients that have come in from that. We&#8217;re looking at some new software here shortly. And the rebrand of our private label is exciting because we’re working to expand our brand beyond Elixir and our guests.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <strong>Devoughn Owens</strong> founded Meadowlark Home Care in 1997, it was her instincts that told her people would always need nurses, not statistics. Home care services is one of the fastest growing industries in the country. According the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, it&#8217;s projected to grow <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm#tab-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41%</a> from 2016-2026.</p>
<p>Devoughn started out in undergrad at Louisiana State and majored in journalism, she had no intention of becoming anything besides a journalist. However, when she graduated, there were no jobs in her area of study. She worked a few jobs here and there, but that was it. It was then she decided it wasn’t working out and she needed to do something productive. She made the tough decision and went back to school. She told herself &#8220;no matter what is going on in the world, I’m going to graduate with a degree that will serve me for many years to come.&#8221; Wayne State University had an accelerated nursing program, so pursued that because there is always need for nurses.</p>
<p>After she graduated she worked in the Intensive Care Unit at Detroit Receiving Hospital and then at Western Wayne Correctional Facility. At that time, she and her brother wanted to set up a group home together. We looked at group homes in Detroit, but most weren’t set up for them to be grandfathered in, which would’ve been more cost effective. She already had a house in Oak Park, and that wound up working out. &#8220;I made the decision in May 1997 to use my home for the group home, and in October 1997, I was licensed and up and running.&#8221;</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">1.</span> What services does your business provide?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>We specialize in home care services for patients with mental illness, dementia, and developmental disabilities. I have two homes that are at capacity: one in Oak Park and Southfield. Our goal is to meet their mental, physical, and spiritual needs in order for them to be as complete and whole as possible.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">2.</span> Did you learn how to run your business on the fly, or did you have any help from friends or peers? </strong></h4>
<p>I came into contact with a lot of individuals who had a wealth of knowledge about the Adult Foster Care business and they were not afraid to share their information. With my Journalism and Nursing degrees, it made it easy to set the foundation for the business to develop policies and procedures, employee and client files, and to meet off of the state and local agency requirements.</p>
<p>My advice to other business owners would be to collect as much knowledge as possible and be a sponge when people are willing to share their stories. Don&#8217;t be afraid to pursue your dreams and your vision. God gave them to you don&#8217;t let them go to waste. Walk in your talents and take hold of any and all counsel that you receive along the way.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174537 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Melowlark-website-home.jpg?resize=800%2C462&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="462" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Melowlark-website-home.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Melowlark-website-home.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Melowlark-website-home.jpg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">3.</span> How do you market your services to potential clients? </strong></h4>
<p>For me, it’s less about putting ads on social media or in the newspaper. In my business, it starts by developing those face-to-face relationships with agencies such as Macomb Oakland Regional Center (MORC) and Easter Seals, and the families of the individuals that we provide services for. Once we got to know each other and they were able to see how the clients were progressing and how comfortable they were with our services, a level of trust was established. When you build and maintain a level of trust this enables contracts to continue to be renewed.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff"> 4.</span> </strong><strong>What types of challenges do you and your employees encounter on a daily basis, and how do you handle them?</strong></h4>
<p>I have 14 employees and I think that I’ve been fortunate that my staff has been around for a little while. Like in many businesses, employees who don’t have the same intent as you, or lack compassion toward their clients or peers eventually weed themselves out. As the business owner, the hardest thing is to get everyone to buy into your vision, and in my case, my vision is to treat people like their family. In the end, whether they do or don’t is a direct reflection on me.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff"> 5.</span> </strong><strong>It must be rewarding, to provide care to people who otherwise cannot care for themselves. Do you see your business as a business, or something else? </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I can be a nurse doing other things or working in other facilities making more money than I am now. But that’s not what I want to do. I feel I was put on this earth for this purpose. Servicing individuals is my passion and calling.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">6.</span> </strong><strong>What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I am always looking at ways to expand and grow my business on a daily basis. I try to find out what the need is with the local agencies that we provide services for and expand on that. I pray that God will continue to put me in a position to meet individuals that can help me with this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174539 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Medowlark-website-1.jpg?resize=800%2C461&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="461" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Medowlark-website-1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Medowlark-website-1.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Medowlark-website-1.jpg?resize=768%2C443&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">7.</span> What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I’ve been in business for over 20 years. So, when I initially started, I did a line of credit off the home to do renovations and get things up and running. Things were a lot different back then. But all things change over time, from the agencies I worked with to how I financed my business.</p>
<p>I had tried to get money from my bank, but they said my debt ratio was too high. I banked with them for so long, and they knew how much money I had! It was very frustrating. But then I found OnDeck and they took me on.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">8.</span> How are you using your OnDeck funds? </strong></h4>
<p>I have both a term loan and a line of credit from OnDeck, and I’m using both to sustain the business when I have vacancies in my homes. Any business owner knows that your revenues can change over a period of time, but expenses do not. So how do you meet the expenses when the revenue goes down? You need to borrow a little until you fill that vacancy so you can keep paying your bills, make payroll, etc. It’s smart business. I thank God for OnDeck because they were willing to give me a chance when no other lending agency would. I will always be grateful and thankful for OnDeck.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">9.</span> What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></h4>
<p>I have to say I’m blessed because a lot of group homes have closed, but we’re still here. But I admit, I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up! I want to grow the business responsibly and not get too big, because you run the risk of losing touch and not provide the personal service your patients are used to. I might look at expanding our services to do something else, like workshops teaching people basic life skills. Some programs out there now do more for certain individuals and others there not. I’d like to bridge that gap.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Reed Shiraki, the owner of Honor Box Chiropractic, a practice in Pearl City, Hawaii. (yes, we&#8217;re jealous!) His business story is inspiring and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>1. Tell us about your background and how you started your business.</strong></span></h4>
<p>My journey to chiropractor and small business owner was not a straight path. When I graduated high school I actually wanted to be a painter, so when I enrolled in BYU-Provo I was an art major. I did my church mission in Hiroshima, Japan and came back with a refreshed view of what I wanted to do. I became a recreational management major because I really enjoyed working with kids.</p>
<p>I switched majors again at the encouragement of my now wife, Eriko. My new plan was to graduate with a Japanese language bachelor&#8217;s and then go to law school. I was on my way, but then four months later it dawned on me &#8211; I didn’t want to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>I visited the BYU Counseling and Career Center for some inspiration and as I was browsing the brochures I saw one on chiropractic and what a career could be. I knew instantly that’s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Three months later, my pregnant wife and I moved from Provo to Kansas City so I could attend Cleveland Chiropractic College. In 1998, we moved back to Hawaii and I started as an associate at Hawaii Chiropractic Clinic in Aiea, Not too long after I opened up Hawaiian Pacific Chiropractic in Kalihi. In 2013, I opened a new clinic in Pearl City and renamed my practice Honor Box Chiropractic.</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">2. What services does your business provide?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Everything we do centers around the chiropractic adjustment. The first appointment includes palpation and observation of movement and posture, physiotherapy (like ice, heath, traction, or elective stimulation), and a percussion massage to loosen up the back. In the second appointment, our customers can expect their adjustment.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YkxBRKbKGNM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">3. What is The Honor Box Code, and what does it mean to provide care to those who may not be able to afford it or who cannot use their insurance?</strong></h4>
<p>I truly believe that spinal alignment is a key element of good health. Most people look at chiropractic as if it&#8217;s a kind of luxury &#8212; something nice to treat yourself with from time to time, especially when pain hits. However, I believe a healthy spine is absolutely necessary to achieve optimal health. The Honor Box provides a way for me take care of every single person who walks into my office, regardless of their financial situation. This Honor Box system is often called a blessing by my patients who use and appreciate it, but it actually is a greater blessing for our practice, because it allows me to focus solely on the welfare of the patient without the stress and worry of &#8220;selling&#8221; my services. The Honor Box has helped me develop into the best chiropractor I can be.</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">4. You have some great reviews on Facebook and your website. How valuable are testimonials and reviews to your business?</strong></h4>
<p>Right now, to me, the value of positive reviews and testimonials have less to do with attracting new business, and way more to do with the way that these affirmations from others reinforce to us that we are doing the right thing, in the right way, and offering a service that is truly appreciated by others. This is a boost to our Honor Box&#8217;s team morale and strengthens are resolve to persevere and press forward, knowing we are on the right track.</p>

<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">5. What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></h4>
<p>Because of the volatile nature of collections through the Honor Box, it is vital that I record and analyze stats on a daily basis. Key stats I look at every day include: amount of total patient visits, amount of new patient visits, total collections for the day, and the average amount collected per patient visit. While the fluctuations of stats between the highs and lows can be overwhelming at times, over the years since 2001, I have a firm idea of what I can rely on as an expected average of these key stats when looked at with a long-term perspective.</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">6. What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What about your industry made it challenging to obtain financing?</strong></h4>
<p>In 2013, I really wanted to move my practice from Honolulu to Pearl City. There was a perfect office space available at the time where I wanted to set up my practice. The move, new lease agreement, and build-out costs would &#8211; on a shoestring budget &#8211; run me close to 100K. My savings, a business line of credit from my bank, and a SBA loan would cover just over half of that. Right when I thought that the new office would not work out, I got an OnDeck mailer. I thought that I had nothing to lose, so I applied. I was stunned how quick the approval and funding happened. Where my local bank took several weeks to approve my SBA loan and then get the funds into my account, OnDeck took only a couple days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-174014 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=800%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HB-3.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">7. How have you used your OnDeck financing?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I originally used OnDeck funds to build my dream practice in Pearl City. Since then, I&#8217;ve used additional financing to run advertising campaigns on radio and TV, as well as extra working capital to hire a new doctor to work here with me at Honor Box Chiropractic. My last weeks of practice in my Honolulu office, I was averaging about 285 patient visits a week. Last week, my office cared for 527 – that’s an 85% increase! We are growing!</p>
<h4><strong style="color: #0074ff">8. What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business? What’s on the horizon for Honor Box Chiropractic?</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>I am most excited when I think about all the people we can still help. The ones who are currently racked with pain taking pill after pill just to find some relief &#8211; who with chiropractic can get off the prescriptions and start enjoying life. I am excited to help more and more patients achieve a better life through chiropractic care. In 2018, we will be using some of OnDeck financing to launch a one-year newspaper campaign to tell even more people in Hawaii about the Honor Box and the power of chiropractic!</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of speaking with OnDeck customer, Meghan Garrity, owner of <strong>Performance Detailing, </strong>an auto detailing and performance parts service in Orland Park, IL. We talked about her background, what it&#8217;s like to own a small business, how she and her husband Doug manage the day-to-day, as well as prepare for the future.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: Tell me about your background.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meghan Garrity:</strong> My background is in management. I worked in restaurants for over 15 years, and went through the whole gamut – waitress, bartender, and manager – at a popular chain named after a day of the week. The skills I learned in the restaurant business have helped with managing people and with customer service. Doug’s background is in high performance automobiles, including wrenching and racing. Doug helped build one of the fastest street cars for Sutton Ford when their High Performance Parts department was still open. Doug and his brother race 79’ trans Am and a 70.5’ Trans Am. They are fixtures at Route 66 in Joliet, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How did the idea of your business begin, and what services does your business provide?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Doug always wanted to own some sort of speed shop or detailing business. When he was let go from Ford because of the recession, we thought it would be a brilliant time to open a business. He led Ford’s High Performance Department, so he had a lot of valuable experience. And I always said, if we can start a business during a down economy, we can get through anything.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I wish we knew that the leap of faith was going to be worth the struggle! We started with no employees and no money, so like a lot of business owners we pinched pennies and worked all hours of the night. I was about six months pregnant at the time with our first child and still working a full-time job. Doug would work until midnight and start again at 7am. The shop had to work because that was our livelihood.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-172845 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="performance-detailing | OnDeck Resource Center" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detailing-header.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How did you start marketing your services? What tactics have you had the most success with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> When we first started, we used any type of free or low-cost option available: social media, flyers, etc. The best marketing so far has been Groupon, social media, and good old-fashioned word of mouth. Groupon was great for advertising because it got our name out there and also helped with referrals. We see a lot of customers now calling and telling us they are on their second or third vehicle that we have tinted, which is really exciting! We also do work for our village’s Public Works Department, and that has been beneficial to getting our name out to a larger local audience, including the police and fire departments. Doug’s ties to the automotive community helps, too, since car guys like doing work with other car guys!</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: You have a storefront and an online store. What are the different ways you market products on both, and are the promotion elements the same or different? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I am able to do most of my marketing from the comfort of my home using different apps and social media platforms. Strategy is mostly the same, but depending on what I am marketing, it makes a difference in whom I am marketing to. Jeep and off-road accessories are usually marketed online, while detailing and tint is usually marketed through email or local platforms. Sales are mostly from local dealership business and online comes from a large Female Jeep club I admin on.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: Speaking of social media, you have a robust presence on a few platforms. What is the key to keeping up with regular posts, and do you have any tips that may help other business owners with their social media? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Social media is extremely important, especially when dealing with a younger demographic. My biggest advice is to stay current and relevant and post and respond often. Follow businesses that inspire you and have a good presence, and this will give you a template for what to post. Also, I use many different apps on my phone for adding text and watermarks &#8211; this helps with uniformity.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How valuable customer reviews to your business, and how do you handle any negative comments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Reviews are important, but unfortunately in today’s world you get fake negative reviews from time to time.  As far as responding to our reviews, we always look to fix any type of negative situation with a positive as soon as we can. Whether the customer is willing to work with us on a resolve is another issue. If we believe the review is false we simple respond with additional questions like “when were you here, what vehicle did you have.” I think our customers are savvy enough to spot a real review from a fake.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> We monitor a lot of metrics including website traffic, Google ads, and Facebook trends. This gives me a good idea of what is working and what isn’t. We can usually see if an ad is working based on the clicks and sales. The weather plays a big part in our sales, too. When the first snowstorm hits, we see products like remote starters skyrocket!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172846" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="performance-detailing | OnDeck Resource Center" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/performance-detialing-3.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What was it like looking for financing as a small business owner? What sources of capital did you look into? What did you like about OnDeck?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Financing is hard especially when you are a new business. Banks want to see numbers and a good credit history. We turned to OnDeck for our last 5-6 small loans. Honestly, we researched other banks and companies, and our OnDeck representative is friendly and takes time out to talk with us. It’s the customer service that stood out to me.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: How has OnDeck helped your business grow? ROI, hires, top/bottom line increases, new clients?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> OnDeck has given us the freedom to run our business with peace of mind. It has been a convenient and simple process obtaining the funds needed for our business. We recently expanded and had quite a bit of overhead with new flooring, lighting, displays, and more. OnDeck was able to provide us with the money we needed to make it a smooth transition. With the expansion, we were able to purchase new equipment that helped to speed up operation and increase our profit by 20% in that department.</p>
<p><strong>OnDeck: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> Doug and I are looking forward to retirement! But until then, we’d like to franchise or open a second location.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sue Kolupar spent 36 years in the medical field at a practice, and her daughters were in a German dance group and went to a formal ball every year. That meant that each year she had to look for dresses. Fast-forward years later and one of her daughters went off to college in California, and she returned home to Milwaukee to buy a specific dress for a dance. They went to find this special dress at the same shop they used to go to all the time, but they found out the shop closed because the owner passed away. Sue called the strip mall to see if they would sell her any of the remaining dresses, and the person on the phone asked, “you want to buy the store?” and she first answered, “no, just a dress!” But after thinking about the business opportunity, she told her husband that it would be fun to have the shop as a side business, so she did! She bought the shop in 2006, and a year later she was diagnosed with breast cancer and fired from her medical job. &#8220;That helped me decide to take over the shop.&#8221; <a href="http://dressedintime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dressed in Time</strong></a> sells prom and pageant dresses mostly, along with some mother-of-the-bride and bridesmaids dresses, too.</p>
<h4><strong>Jenn Prystupa, OnDeck: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Sue Kolupar, Owner of Dressed in Time:</strong> Social media marketing! I wish I was more technically savvy. I’m trying to market a different crowd – teenage girls. Back in the day, we would advertise on radio, newspaper, the Yellow Pages – that doesn’t work for this type of business anymore and definitely not for my target customers. We need to compete with the online stories and to do so, we need to advertise online. We’re doing that now, but I wish I knew more much sooner.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: Who makes up your client base? How do you establish relationships, especially with families? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> High school girls and their parents are my core clients. I’m super hands on in my shop and I have hardly any staff, so each customer takes up a lot of my time, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m all about customer service, and I will bend over backwards for them.</p>
<p>Word of mouth at the eight local high schools is huge for me. I have the opportunity to sell a dress to one girl at least twice in her high school tenure, so it’s important to provide the best possible customer service to her, her parents, siblings and friends so I can keep that relationship going. I also hire a few girls who have the opportunity to work co-op. It’s great because they get retail experience and see all the new dresses coming in…and then they go tell their friends and parents! I have some girls that are prom customers coming back for white gowns later on in life based on their relationship with me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-170791" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Ribbon.jpg?resize=700%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Ribbon.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Ribbon.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Ribbon.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Ribbon.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>JP: What marketing tactics have you had the most success with?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Much of my marketing is also based on social networks, like Instagram. On that network, I have pictures of girls holding their dress bags, and in the background is a huge banner with my logo. That has gotten me a fair amount of followers because the girls share the photos and their friends see them, too. I also work with an Instagram account called PagentPlanet, which posts a feature dress of the week from me, and I’ve seen growth in followers from that partnership. I find it very important to identify online influencers that your target customers are following, and see how you can engage with their audiences.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: How do you access your business growth?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Each year I’m trying to grow my sales by $50,000. I’m always looking at my sales, what schools are sending me the most customers, and what schools I need to target. There are some schools that buy less than me versus others, so it’s always a challenge to see how I can break through and bring more of them into the fold.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: What made you look for funding? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Every year we’ve grown, but there are times we get low on cash that coincide with opportunities to stock up on the latest fashions. I sell a chunk of inventory January through May, and a little bit through August. Then it kind of drops, but prime time inventory season, even if I still have old inventory on my floor not selling as fast as I’d like. I haven’t taken a salary from this business because of the medical job I had, and I’ve just reinvested my profits into inventory each year. Until I found OnDeck, my old position fed into Dressed in Time, but I still needed additional capital to really get ahead.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-170793" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Header.jpg?resize=700%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dressed-in-Time-OnDeck-Blog" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Header.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Header.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Header.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Dressed-in-Time-Header.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h4><strong>JP: What did you like about OnDeck that made you choose us?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> OnDeck was the easiest to work with. The process was fast, and I felt like they valued my business for what it is. The customer service was fantastic each time I needed something or had a question. That’s very important to me and it defines my business philosophy. You don’t get that personal touch with online and department stores, and for that matter, banks, nowadays.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: How has OnDeck helped your business grow? </strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> We’re on track to hit $70,000 more in sales this year thanks to OnDeck providing me with funds to purchase inventory. I need to be able to buy what I need, when it must be bought, and OnDeck was there for me.</p>
<h4><strong>JP: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of your business?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>SK:</strong> Every year is exciting, trying to beat the previous year’s sales. And I love seeing girls coming into my store each day. It really is a happy atmosphere…the medical field, not so much. I’m not sure what I’m going to do when I approach retirement, but I love the work I do and I love the reward of seeing a smiling face.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Coolidge spent 8.5 years in the Marine Corps, and was always interested in technology. While he was serving, he met another Marine who was going to college for computer science and they began building and marketing some small mobile applications – they then founded Majestyk Apps. Since then, He’s founded several companies, made a few small start-up investments, and mentors other military veterans who are trying to get involved in “tech.”</p>

We’ve established ourselves as one of the best design and tech agencies in New York.</p>
<p>We started by building a few small apps and marketing them on a tiny (sometimes non-existent) budget. This helped us get our name out and we began gradually adding services and doing work for larger and larger brands. In the last 12 months, we’ve launched tech products for six Fortune 500 companies.</p>

We’ve done really well over the last few years even though we made a very obvious mistake right in the beginning. We purposely misspelled our name, and that’s caused some challenges marketing the company because people will search for us by using “majestic” instead of Majestyk. This has likely caused us to lose lots of potential business and hurts our digital marketing efforts. BUT – we love the name and are too stubborn to rebrand it.</p>

We weren’t in any position to spend big on marketing, so we really relied on the strengths of our relationships from our young professional careers. We took a leap of faith with our contacts in key industries, and asked for introductions. They trust us already, which saved us a lot of time. We broke even or lost money on most of our early projects in order to build our portfolio. That’s why going to a traditional lender didn’t work for us.</p>

Each with their own pros and cons.</p>
<p>Startups have smaller budgets and you always face the potential of never getting paid. But, they typically have better payment terms and it is a lot of fun to dig into their strategy and help them build from the ground up.  It’s amazing to watch a first time entrepreneur get their app accepted by the app store and “launched” for the first time.</p>
<p>The corporate clients are great because they have more resources to invest into the projects, and when they launch they have big marketing efforts to help scale. But, they put a large strain on a smaller company’s cash flow because they normally have standard payment terms that are net 90 days or sometimes more. And then you have to navigate through their internal payment process. This was where OnDeck was key for us in providing the funding needed to weather the longer payment terms. Because of that funding early in our growth, we were able to secure our first few Fortune 500 clients. And the apps we built for them were AWESOME.</p>

It’s actually more important to us than profit, which seems counter-intuitive. But we are looking to cement our position in a competitive industry and once we hit our revenue goal, we will optimize our profit margins. A very tech-centric approach.</p>
<p>Eyeballs are another way we can look at our growth. While you can’t always quantify the impact, we can look at the client base we’ve acquired over the last several years – IBM, Citi, Pepsi&#8230;these apps or websites are great for our portfolio and also get millions of people using tech we’ve built. This is great for our brand but also motivates our internal team. They know they are working on really cool products. One website we built just launched with TV commercials at the Grammys.</p>

At first, we went to banks for the financing, but we were turned down because we were a young business without a credit history – and mind you, we were profitable.</p>

The banks require tons of paperwork, which handcuffs the ability to take out the loan. It was a couple days turnaround for OnDeck. And with OnDeck’s quick financing, we won the bids, and from there we started to grow. It was a great move for the portfolio.</p>

We have a great team and culture. My employees are always bring new ideas to the table, which makes us all really excited. We keep asking ourselves: how can we work with influencers? How can we use technology better?</p>
<p>This happened recently when we had a really great concept, internally built a prototype, and pitched it to IBM and their Watson team. They loved it and we partnered with IBM to build it out further. We raised several million dollars in investment, were named a TIME Magazine Best Invention of 2015, spun the company out, and it now has 20 employees. This was 100% conceived within Majestyk by our amazing team.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every so often I have the pleasure of meeting small business owners who dazzle me with the inventiveness of their products, passion, business know-how, and their desire to share that know-how with other small business owners. Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking with the winners of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/ondeck-seal-of-approval-winners">OnDeck’s Seal of Approval</a></span></span> contest; Rachelle and Paul Baron founders of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a target="_blank" style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://beauandbellelittles.com/">Beau &amp; Belle Littles</a></span></span>. The Barons have the perfect storm of a great product, great marketing, and sales skills, and that type of determination only entrepreneurs possess to make their business successful.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;"><strong>About Rachelle and Paul</strong></span></h3>
<p>Paul is a born entrepreneur, with over a half dozen businesses under his belt starting from childhood when he would take his drawing to the grocery store and sell them. “My sales pitch was pretty great, I would ask, “would you like this?” and if they said yes, then I would say, “then that’ll be $0.05.” Most of the time it would work!” Since his first endeavor, he’s been a landscaper, a videographer, and he ran a full-service digital marketing shop doing web development, design, and marketing… just to name a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rachelle received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Northern Colorado in French, which believe it or not, she has actually used to communicate with some of their Canadian customers. (Side note: my dad was also a French major, but he never used it to do anything productive. I love you, dad!) Most of Rachelle’s professional background is in retail, and her experience with running a customer service based business has helped her immensely.</p>
<p>Together, their backgrounds make them a great team and have been extremely beneficial in helping Paul and Rachelle grow Beau and Belle Littles to what it is today.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">Ariele Krantzow, OnDeck: How did the idea of Beau &amp; Belle Littles begin?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul Baron, Beau &amp; Belle Littles:</strong></span> The idea for Beau &amp; Belle Littles came from wanting to have a business so we could help Rachelle make her own schedule because she wanted to be able to stay home with Beau. The idea is all Rachelle actually, I like to think that I’m the entrepreneur in this relationship but she’s really the smart one. When Beau was about 6 months old we were given our first reusable swim diaper, which was made by one of the biggest national brands in baby swimwear. At the time we didn’t even really know that reusable swim diapers existed, but being frugally-minded people we decided to give it a go. Rachelle hated it. <strong>HATED</strong> it. It was supposedly 6-12 month sized but it was SUPER tight around his little legs and we didn’t like how if he did end up pooping in it we’d have to pull it off like underwear, thus pulling the poop all down his legs. Because of this, we were basically forced to use disposable diapers, which neither of us really liked.</p>
<p>Our son, Beau loves water, if that kid could live in a pool or a bath, he would. Because he likes water so much we were blowing through disposable swim diaper and we got really, really tired of wasting money. So we decided to keep looking for reusable options. In our search, we really didn’t find any in the marketplace that we thought were good enough. We thought it would make much more sense to have a one-size-fits-all type swimming diaper rather than the single-sized reusable swim diaper we were given. Furthermore, we wanted it to be both cute and functional. Nothing like that really existed at the time so we decided to investigate making some ourselves.</p>
<p>One thing led to another and it went from just having a few cute swim diapers for Beau and his little friends to eventually manufacturing and selling reusable swim diapers. In July 2015, we launched our very first product on Amazon the Nageuret Swim Diaper. The word Nageuret (pronounced nah-jour-ay) is French and roughly means small/little swimmer. We were absolutely blown away by the reception of our swim diapers, people <span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>LOVED</strong></span> them just as much as we did, and they started selling really, really well in a very short amount of time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: What do you wish you knew before you started your business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> This is a good question. Since the bulk of my experience in running different businesses has always been the service-based business arena, I think one thing that I would have liked to have known is a little bit more about is inventory planning and inventory projections. For example, we were just recently out of stock for 12 days which represented a loss of about $6,000 for one specific product. Knowing how to balance income and revenue with inventory purchasing would be and still is crucial to our success.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle Baron, Beau &amp; Belle Littles:</strong></span> I wish I knew how hard it would be to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/is-financing-business-growth-a-good-idea-for-my-business">find capital</a></span></span> for a business that has no history. That’s been our biggest setback and we have run out of inventory several times because we just didn’t have enough money to order in time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: So, now you have a great product, how did you start getting people to buy it?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong> </span>Initially we asked our friends to try it so that we could see if it was a good product and when they liked it we used Amazon as a launching platform. Using Amazon is nice because they have a lot of traffic already and you don’t have to find traffic you just have to know how to leverage it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">Paul:</span></strong> Amazon to validated that we had a good idea. And to be completely honest we were sort of blown away by the reception our products had. I remember thinking in September 2015, which is technically two months after we launched, that we would sort of plateau at about $8,000 per month in revenue from our two SKUs that we had selling. I was really wrong! By July 2015, with only two skews selling online we hit $50,000 in revenue for just that month. I was absolutely blown away!</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: Besides Amazon, how did you start marketing your products? What tactics have you had the most success with?</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff474a;">Paul:</span></strong> Our Amazon traffic validated our idea, people really loved the Nageuret, so we knew that we had a hit. Our next task was then to begin really driving traffic and sales to our website and increase our brand exposure otherwise. We rely heavily on social media and great press. Because we have such a unique product and we have such a great brand with a good story we have been able to get in several blogs, in some pretty cool magazines, and on several “best of lists,” online and on a few different tv shows; and of course winning the OnDeck Seal of Approval Contest was huge for us!</p>
<p>Right now I’m really in love with influencer marketing, in fact, I’m in developing an app to help make that process a little bit more automated and easy for us, so that’s pretty cool. I’m excited to see how it turns out and I may even monetize that once it’s working for us. Another thing that’s actually pretty cool and has helped us is actually entering contests. There are all kinds of different business contests that you can enter and it’s amazing how many we’ve entered that we are either finalists in or actually one. Obviously, OnDeck is one shining example of a great contest that we won. Another that we were actually finalists for was “emerging business of the year,” presented by the US Chamber of Commerce. We just got back from Washington DC for that award ceremony and we recognized nationally as one of the top 3 emerging businesses in the nation out of hundreds of nominees. This award was cool because we had a chance to meet with our congressman, Jared Polis, who is himself an absolutely incredible entrepreneur. So to sum it up, those three things: influencer marketing, great press, and winning business contests all have a very symbiotic relationship in that they give us great exposure and great organic marketing and have done volumes for our brand.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong></span> To add to that, the people who buy our products primarily are mommies and they spend a lot of time on social media, especially Instagram. So we put a lot of effort in finding mommy bloggers and influencers on Instagram to get our word out. We grew our Facebook following from 400 people to 4,000 in a little over three months just using tools on Facebook and in addition to Facebook Ads.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: Many small businesses are family run, what do you do to keep business and family separate, or can you?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> Oh man this is an absolutely great question! This is really, really difficult actually. One thing that Rachelle and I do is we have a rule that Sundays are our day off. We really do our best to make sure that we don’t do any business at all on Sunday. We try not to even look at our email and we really try not to even talk about the business. That’s more difficult than it may seem though. Since both she and I run the company together, we’re both very passionate about it, naturally we tend to talk a lot about it just in general even when we’re not actually “in business mode.” This is something that we’re still working on, and as the company grows and we had more processes and structure to it I feel like it’s getting a little bit easier than it has been in the past. But like all things in life, I think the key to this is intentionality and making sure that you have distinct boundaries and goals…goals I’m great at, boundaries I’m terrible with; it’s the rebel entrepreneur child in me, haha!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: You won the OnDeck Seal of Approval contest and spoke with Barbara Corcoran, What’s the best advice she gave you and how has your business grown or benefitted from her guidance?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> For me, I think my biggest takeaway from the meeting with Barbara is just trusting our gut more. She really impressed me as just being extremely bright, she’s obviously an amazing businesswoman and one of my personal role models as an entrepreneur. What she’s accomplished is absolutely tremendous and I really value the input that she gave in regards to trusting our gut and making sure that we stay true to our vision. One really cool thing, for me anyway, is in watching shark tank she kind of has this look that she gives people when she’s about to invest in them or make them an offer. During the Forbes interview when Geri Stengel was interviewing her and Rachelle, there was a point where Rachelle was answering a question—I can’t remember which one exactly, but Barbara just kind of sat back and looked at Rachelle and had that “I’m going to make you an offer look,” and I could tell that she saw something in Rachelle. That made me extremely proud (did I mention how I married way above my pay grade?). It was funny actually because Barbara said something to the effect of how she would rather do business with Rachelle over me because Rachelle went with her gut instinct or something like that. I thought it was funny because I was sitting in the room listening to the interview &amp; taking photos for Social and Barbara didn’t even realize that because I was just being quiet watching, I thought it was hilarious!</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: How did you invest your $10k prize from OnDeck? Have you seen any ROI from that investment?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> We put it straight in the inventory!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong></span> We launched a new pattern with the $10,000 that we got from the OnDeck contest and it’s actually our bestseller.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> We have a pretty decent profit margin on our products so we saw about a $5,000 return on it when all was said and done.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: What metrics do you look at to assess your business growth? How often do you look at these numbers?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> I was actually looking at these numbers last night and because we’ve just entered our third year of business we’re able to track our year-over-year and month-over-month growth. So, I look at it on a per SKU level as well as overall growth. Tracking it per SKU, I’m able to see which items are the hottest selling and which items need a little bit more love in terms of marketing efforts. One of the hardest things about that is sometimes a product may have reached the end of its life cycle, so to speak. Trying to figure out if you just need to market that product harder or to remove it and add in a different item is a little bit difficult sometimes when just analyzing raw data. But so far this year on average, we have grown 200% over last year. A lot of that we attribute to the amazing press we received from OnDeck and the advice that we’ve gotten from Barbara Corcoran.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0074ff;">AK: What are you most excited about when thinking about the future of Beau &amp; Belle Littles?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>Paul:</strong></span> I’m super stoked about being able to hire people and expand our product lines and product offerings. When we were in DC for the US Chamber of Commerce Emerging Business of the Year award I mentioned a few things that could really help <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0074ff;"><a style="color: #0074ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/expand-my-small-business">grow our business</a></span></span>. One of which, could actually be almost considered as a pivot for our company in terms of a product offering, which I’m really excited about.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000082;"><strong>Rachelle:</strong></span> We are hoping to launch a few new patterns for our swim diapers, a larger size that can even fit kids that have special needs and aren’t potty trained. There’s a huge gap in the market there for cute or fashionable products. We have been working with someone on getting a start in the Australia also.</p>
<p>At Beau &amp; Belle Littles, our goal is to make the absolute best reusable baby products on the market. We have had absolutely amazing feedback from mommies (and daddies) all over the country that absolutely love our swim diapers. Because of this success, we plan to expand our product line to include different lines of baby and toddler swim and swim-related products between 2017 and 2019; all while keeping our Nageuret line of swim diaper as the cornerstone of our product lineup.</p>
<p><strong>I want to leave you off with this inspirational thought Paul had when talking about all the businesses he’s started:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>“</strong></span>Most of the businesses I started were failures, but the great thing about failures is that as long as you don’t let them identify you as a “failure,” and rather you look at them as learning experiences, then those experiences/lessons that you learn in those failures helping more on your path towards success than almost any other lesson would.<span style="color: #ff474a;"><strong>”</strong></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #0074ff">Managing Your Cash Flow is Critical to Success: Even A Dentist Agrees</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you visit your dentist (twice a year) you might not think about how they run their business. Neither did we, but we learned that it’s not as easy as finishing dental school and putting out an &#8220;open for business&#8221; sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dino and Tina Mantis, a husband and wife team, founded Mantis Dentistry in 1989. They specialize in a wide range of dental services, including cosmetic dentistry, dental implants, orthodontics, as well as dentistry for children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Dino Mantis <em>loves helping his patients</em> – he’s studied the teachings of five of the leading dental lecturers in the World, allowing his patients the finest in dental care at all levels. Dr. Mantis has extensive experience performing restorative dentistry, orthodontics, and cosmetic dentistry, offering a holistic approach taking into account the health of each patient’s teeth, gums, jaw joints, and facial muscles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Dino works with the patients, <em>Tina handles everything else</em> – from paperwork and office management to everything in between.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-167278 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mantis-Dentistry_OnDeck-Small-Business-Loans_3.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mantis-Dentistry_OnDeck-Small-Business-Loans_3.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mantis-Dentistry_OnDeck-Small-Business-Loans_3.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mantis-Dentistry_OnDeck-Small-Business-Loans_3.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mantis-Dentistry_OnDeck-Small-Business-Loans_3.jpg?resize=399%2C224&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Mantis-Dentistry_OnDeck-Small-Business-Loans_3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>During Tina’s tenure, she has helped steer the company to accomplish the following: </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Guided the practice towards helping over 1,000 patients a year </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Advocated for and trains all new employees – more than 15 in the last year </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Provided guidance and recommendations on securing financing for the business </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kimberly Solarz, OnDeck’s Director of Brand, sat down with </span><b>Tina Mantis of Mantis Dentistry</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to learn about how her smart approach to managing cash flow helped her achieve her goals and what it takes to keep their business running and growing year after year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: Tina, thanks for taking the time to chat with me. To start, tell us a bit about how you got started in the dental industry. </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">My husband and I have been running this practice for over 20 years. My husband is the dentist, and I handle the books – we’ve always divided and conquered in that way. For as long as I’ve known him, he’s always wanted to be a dentist. He just loves it.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000082"><strong>&#8220;He just loves it.&#8221;</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after he finished school and became a dentist we decided it would be beneficial for us to join forces and open a practice together. He would take care of technical and patient side, and I would do administrative side of the business. It’s been more than 20 years, so I think we’ve learned a thing or two along the way!</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: Any tips for other husband and wife teams? How do you decide who handles what aspects of the business? </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d say the most important thing to do is to agree on a philosophy to run the business around. You need to be a team and stand together towards a shared vision. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/all-in-the-family-how-to-thrive-running-a-small-business-with-family?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=mantisdentistry&amp;utm_content=article1">Communication is super important</a></span></span>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another important thing to understand is each person’s strengths, and be honest about what those strengths are. You must honor that strength and make sure the right person is handling the right task. So, if one person has better communication skills, then that person should handle all of the employee relations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conversely, you also must be honest about what you maybe aren’t as good at or don’t even like doing and find ways to solve for that too. The best tip I can give is just to be open about what your strengths and weaknesses are and then manage around that. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: What has been your biggest challenging in managing your cash flow, and how have you overcome that challenge? </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">The biggest challenge in <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/putting-your-best-foot-forward-finding-or-rather-becoming-your-profit-expert?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=inlinearticle&amp;utm_campaign=mantisdentistry&amp;utm_content=article2">managing cash flow</a></span></span> is the gap between our accounts receivable and accounts billable. The timing doesn’t always match up. So, for example, if one of our patients takes two weeks to pay us, but we need to pay a lab for results today, we run into an issue. This dynamic creates a very serious cash flow conversion cycle issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way we overcame this challenge was by putting a reserve account in place – you need to have cash on hand to account for this. Thankfully there are small business loan providers like OnDeck that small businesses can use to address this exact issue. They value things about your business others don’t – like how long you’ve been in business, how much revenue you make, etc. They base their decisions on information like that which is incredibly helpful. We took out several loans with OnDeck for this exact reason for several years. It has been incredibly helpful for us. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: What are some of your key dos and don’ts for managing cash flow? </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">My “do” and my “don’t” are the same – you need to have a reserve account to manage the gap between services rendered and services paid. Any dental practice needs that cushion to account for that gap. I think that’s the niche that OnDeck fills – they understand what a small business like mine needs when it comes to financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can be the best, most responsible, most conservative business owner in the world, but at the end of the day, you still need financing you can rely on. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: At what point do you think it makes sense to seek financing for your practice? How do you know if it’s the right time? </b></span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: #000082">Tina:</span> </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You know it’s the right time once you have committed to the business and understand that you are in it for the long haul. That’s how we did it – we knew we had a viable business and wanted to keep our overhead low, but needed financing during some slower times due to the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think you just need to be honest with yourself about when you need the financing based on everything that’s going on, both inside and outside of your company. And, you need to think critically about what you’re investing in, your ability to pay it back, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You shouldn’t wait too long – you want to act with a sense of urgency when you need financing and just be honest with yourself.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7azriO_wx5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: How do you manage tracking your cash flow? Is that something you outsource, or do you do everything in-house? </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">I do everything with Quickbooks. I check this daily, and it’s critical to how I approach my side of the business. I’d encourage everyone managing their own practice to do the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: What role has access to capital played in your ability to grow your business? </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Having access to capital has been critical to our success. It’s given me the opportunity to pay my vendors and keep my overhead low while we’re growing. It also keeps your mind at ease so you can focus on growing the business instead of getting so wrapped up in needing to pay your bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: What advice do you have for other professionals who are thinking about seeking outside capital? </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t wait – it’s easy and it truly helps your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>KS: Where do you see your business five or 10 years from now? What’s your plan to get there?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000082"><b>Tina: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400">We want to be the go-to provider for oral systemic health. Our goal is to maintain our leadership position by continuing to focus on quality care and putting the patient first.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff">Building a Business: Helping Breast Cancer Survivors One Bra at a Time</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #000082"><em>An interview with OnDeck customer Dana Donofree, owner of Ana Ono Intimates</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0074ff"><a target="_blank" style="color: #0074ff" href="https://www.anaono.com/">Ana Ono</a></span>, a lingerie line designed specifically for breast cancer survivors, is the brainchild of Dana Donofree of Philadelphia, PA. <span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>“</strong></span>As a breast cancer survivor and a fashion designer, my purpose is to give other survivors an opportunity to reclaim their identity and femininity through custom lingerie.<span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ana-Ono-68-1000.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-162711"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-162711" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ana-Ono-68-1000.jpg?resize=1000%2C660&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ana Ono-Small business loans | OnDeck" width="1000" height="660" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ana-Ono-68-1000.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ana-Ono-68-1000.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ana-Ono-68-1000.jpg?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Dana launched Ana Ono in 2014, after her own battle with breast cancer in 2010. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at the young age of 27. At the time, Dana had an active lifestyle, she was a budding fashion designer, and felt untouchable (as most of us did in our 20s). After her surgery, she wasn’t feeling like her old self; she felt as if she was losing her identity to cancer and the recovery process. As a young woman, she was shocked and jarred that the underwear she usually liked didn’t fit her anymore.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ff474a">“My body changed.”</span></h3>
<p>After speaking with many breast cancer survivors and hearing these women’s stories, Dana realized that this was a common problem. She decided to take her experience as a fashion designer and designed intimates that fit, as well as providing services and other products to assist women post-op.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an amazing few years in business, using funds from OnDeck, Dana designed and introduced her RecoveryWear line. After a mastectomy, women have drains coming out of their bodies for up to six weeks post-surgery. Along with the trauma of the actual surgery, these drains and the lack of ability to fit them into normal bras can mess with a woman’s confidence and body image. Doctors and healthcare providers don’t give any solutions for the drain problem. What makes RecoveryWear unique is that every piece has solutions to hide and work around these drains.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>“</strong>[My goal] is to help women heal in beauty and in dignity after their surgery.<strong>”</strong></span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Dana came to OnDeck in 2016 through our partnership with Intuit. <span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>“</strong></span>I remember the process being smooth and straightforward, it can be incredibly stressful; fortunately, OnDeck had quick questions and quick responses. I could see how much financing I was approved for and what that meant [regarding payback]. I had the opportunity to review everything before I took the loan. The speed and efficiency of the process were incredible.<span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>”</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a">Ana Ono’s RecoveryWear line sold out immediately, and Ana Ono has increased sales 4X over.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>An Interview with RT Custer, Co-Founder of Vortic Watch Company</strong></h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to the owner and co-founder of Vortic Watch Company, RT Custer. Vortic Watch Company is a high-end wristwatch engineering and manufacturing company based in Fort Collins, Colorado. RT and his partner, Tyler Wolfe, started the company while still in college at Pennsylvania State University. The two have long had a passion for classic watchmaking techniques and timepieces and turned that passion into the prestigious and unique manufacturer that Vortic is today. RT and his team <strong>combine the cutting-edge technology of metal 3D printing with gorgeous, antique, American-made pocket watch movements to create bespoke wristwatches</strong>. Every single aspect of their watches – from the leather straps to the technology inside – right here in the US.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Since launching in 2014, RT and team have accomplished the following:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaled the business from making 100 watches per year to making more than 250 watches per year – and they are <strong>on track to quadruple the business in 2017</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Significantly brought down the cost of making their watches</strong> by investing in the right kind of equipment and making smart inventory purchases</li>
<li>Has <strong>hired and trained four employees</strong>, with plans to onboard more.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>We spoke with RT about how smart investments in equipment and inventory have helped him secure these wins.</strong></span></h4>

<p><strong>RT Custer, Founder of Vortic Watch Company:</strong> We started Vortic when I was still in college. My business partner, Tyler and I came up with the idea while we were on the golf course!  He wanted to make a fully American-made wristwatch using some of the technology I was studying in college. We spent a lot of time talking through the concept and how we would approach it. We then put it on Kickstarter and raised $40,000 to buy our first 3-D printer and our initial inventory.</p>

<h3><strong>Very interesting that you started on Kickstarter. What did you learn from this experience, and would you recommend it to other manufacturers? </strong></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-160381"><img class="alignleft wp-image-160381" style="float: left;margin: 5px 15px 10px 0" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="RT Vortic Watch Company - OnDeck Small Business Loans" width="50" height="50" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2728&amp;ssl=1 2728w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong>Kickstarter, and crowdfunding in general, is what you make of it. Just because you have a great idea and put it out there doesn’t mean anyone will see it. It’s like having the best website ever, but if you don’t drive traffic or promote it on Google or FB, there is a chance no one will see it. So, Kickstarter became this amazing platform where we could drive all our friends and family, and then their friends and family members, to promote our idea. <strong>What I learned from the experience is that it’s not Kickstarter that it made us successful, it was our story and connections and marketing strategy that made it successful.</strong></p>
<p>In terms of recommending Kickstarter to others, for those in the consumer products space, there are a lot of financing options now. You have Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc. The whole crowdfunding industry has boomed, so I would recommend trying it.</p>
<p>But again, you must do it right and approach it as a campaign and not expect the platform to do all the work for you. It’s a great thing to do as part of a funding portfolio, but not the only way to get money.</p>

<h3><strong>What has been the biggest challenging in scaling your business, and how did you overcome that challenge?</strong></h3>

<p>Cash flow is the simplest answer. Obviously, we have a fun business, and our product is great to make, and we have excellent reviews. But, our sales cycle is very slow due to the price point. To keep my cost of goods at a manageable level, I need to order hundreds of parts. I’m then restoring hundreds of components of the watches which is very, very slow. The lead times for all my components are very long. <strong>Managing my whole supply chain is complicated and the root cause of my cash flow challenges</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ve had so many ideas on how to make the process and products better that sometimes when that new idea gets implemented, and you start making money from it, it’s almost 6 – 9 months later. We sold &#8220;Version 1&#8221; of our product for almost 18 months, even though we started developing version 2 within our first 6 months. It took us over a year to develop.</p>
<p>In terms of managing the production process, <strong>having access to capital is key</strong>. We’ve raised equity-based financing to get cash in the bank and came to OnDeck for additional capital. We also took pre-orders, where customers paid 50% up front which was super helpful for cash flow. It’s how we survived through the holiday season. It’s a great idea in concept, but you must have an amazing sales team to make that strategy work.</p>

<h3><strong>When do you think it makes sense to finance purchases like inventory or equipment, or do you try to use cash flow to buy what you need? Are there some types of manufacturing equipment or inventory that’s easier to finance than others?</strong></h3>

<p>When we came out with “Version 2” of our product, we thought it was as close to final as we could get. We felt strongly about the product and we wanted to invest money into it. We considered our cost of goods sold and we thought if we could buy 500 watches in terms of parts, instead of 100, we would be on the right track for quadrupling our output.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you must think about your economies of scale – with cash flow you can get to one level, but with financing you can get to an entirely new place. This increases your margins, and your cash flow, and ultimately your revenue and profit for your business.</p>

<p><strong><strong><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-160381"><img class="alignleft wp-image-160381" style="float: left;margin: 5px 15px 10px 0" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="RT Vortic Watch Company - OnDeck Small Business Loans" width="50" height="50" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2728&amp;ssl=1 2728w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong>The more you <em>can</em> do yourself the more you <em>should</em> do yourself.</strong></p>
<p>In the watch industry, we call that “bringing it in-house.” Rolex is a great example of that – they are completely vertically integrated they make everything themselves. That’s part of their brand and value – it allows you to maintain a phenomenal quality and control the cost of goods to a T. It’s very expensive to get to this point – you must buy every machine, hire and train every person. For Rolex, this is literally billions of dollars’ worth of investments.</p>
<p>My first hire in the company probably should have been a watchmaker, but he was a graphic designer. If I hadn’t of hired him on an entry-level salary, I would have had to pay an outside agency 4x or 5x of what I have paid him. We also hired a web developer to build an online experience where customers can design their own watch on our website. Having him rather than hiring an agency, saved us tens of thousands of dollars. Now we are doing that with manufacturing – with the financing from OnDeck we are buying more equipment, bringing manufacturing in-house and decreasing our overall cost of goods.</p>
<p>My biggest piece of advice is to try to have as much control over the creation process as you can so can control your costs. And if you aren’t technical, you can still be actively involved in the process. Every time I hire a new supplier, I physically sit down with them because I want to understand what they do and know exactly what I’m paying for. This eliminates a lot of questions and confusion, which ultimately reduces costs down the road.</p>

<h3><strong>How do you manage your inventory? Have you made any arrangements with your suppliers, so you don’t have to keep all of your inventory on the shelf?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-160381"><img class="alignleft wp-image-160381" style="float: left;margin: 5px 15px 10px 0" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#038;ssl=1" alt="RT Vortic Watch Company - OnDeck Small Business Loans" width="50" height="50" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2728&amp;ssl=1 2728w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Low-Res-Headshot-RTSquare.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong>If I buy 500 screws, which is a really small order in the industry, I have to keep it in inventory. We have to hold that inventory ourselves. Thankfully most of our expensive inventory is labor-based. So labor is more expensive than the physical inventory, which saves us a lot in terms of cashflow so long as everything is timed correctly.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to pay your bills on time. Sounds simple, but if you give someone a PO, they make you 500 screws and you get net 30 and then you don’t pay them within that 30 days, they will not make anything for you ever again. You can burn bridges fast.</p>
<p>There was one time I was going to be 2 days late and I called a vendor on day 29 and I told them I needed a few more days. They were astonished that I called and were so thankful that I asked for more time. It helped create trust between us. Integrity matters. We need more people to do that in our industry, especially if we want American manufacturing to thrive.</p>

This is critical – and what will make your customers come back.</p>
<p>That’s why every website promotes their ratings on Facebook and Google. And even beyond social ratings, word of mouth is the most important. I’ve met 80% of my suppliers by sending quotes to some people and they referred me to someone else…it’s a tight industry and your reputation is everything.</p>

<h3><strong>What role has access to capital played in your ability to grow your business? </strong></h3>

I could run my business off simply cash flow, but not without serious planning and perfect timing. Without banks the world would be ok, it would just be really stressful. If I don’t have a funding source, because I’m constantly aware of my inventory levels and running out of inventory, that’s when I don’t sleep.</p>
<p>That’s why companies like OnDeck are so important – they help you build your business credit while removing stressful ups and downs in cashflow which is really helpful for businesses like mine.</p>

We want to be known as a product development company and a brand. We want to build more amazing one-of-kind products, and we won’t always just make watches. We get approached by other brands all the time who want us to make products for them because they’ve seen the quality of our work or they want to build their products here in America like we do. We’ve recently started getting into private-label manufacturing which is both fun and has huge potential.</p>
