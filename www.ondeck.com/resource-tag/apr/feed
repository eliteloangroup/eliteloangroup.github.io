<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What is short-term business financing?</b></span></h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><b>Short-Term business financing includes financing with terms less </b><b>than 24 months. </b></h4>
<p>Whether it’s a term loan or a line of credit, the best use case for a short-term loan is for projects where the business need has a clear short-term ROI.</p>
<p>Traditional lenders, such as banks, do not typically offer short-term <span style="font-weight: 400">small business loans. Online lenders, like OnDeck, offer short-term </span><span style="font-weight: 400">loans and lines of credit to meet a variety of small business use </span><span style="font-weight: 400">cases. Some business owners, especially those with long-standing </span><span style="font-weight: 400">relationships with their banks, sometimes have questions about </span><span style="font-weight: 400">short-term loans.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>Not in the mood to read? Watch a 6 minute video about this topic below:</b></span></h3>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What business needs are a good fit for short-term financing?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first question you should ask yourself when you begin the process of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">securing financing for your business is: what is your business need? Your </span><span style="font-weight: 400">answer to this question will determine what type of financing and loan </span><span style="font-weight: 400">term is appropriate for your business. Do you need the funds quickly? Do </span><span style="font-weight: 400">you need the funds for a project that will capture additional ROI in a short </span><span style="font-weight: 400">period of time? Different types of financing are appropriate for different </span><span style="font-weight: 400">business needs.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169794 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=1616%2C530&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1616" height="530" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?w=1616&amp;ssl=1 1616w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.03-AM.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Examples of business needs for short-term financing to fuel growth <span style="font-weight: 400">or increase ROI are: a physical expansion or renovation, hiring a new </span><span style="font-weight: 400">employee, buying inventory quickly, or purchasing equipment. These and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">similar initiatives can help your business growth long-term, and generally </span><span style="font-weight: 400">provide realized gains fairly quickly. The loan term should match the useful </span><span style="font-weight: 400">life of the asset just as you wouldn’t take a 30-year auto loan for your car, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">even if the payments were smaller.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>What costs make sense? APR vs. Cents on the Dollar</b></span></h2>
<p>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is only one way to compare your financing <span style="font-weight: 400">options. APR represents the total interest cost, including fees, as an annualized rate which may appear higher than the actual overall cost of a short term loan. In many cases, the APR of a short-term loan can be much higher than the APR for a longer-term loan. But when you consider other factors, such as total cost of the loan and your business need, you can see a short-term loan could be a better fit for your business. As you see in the example below, the shorter-term loan has a higher APR, but a lower overall cost than the longer term loan with the lower APR.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>Let’s run some numbers to illustrate the point.</i></b></span></h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169795 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=1666%2C896&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1666" height="896" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?w=1666&amp;ssl=1 1666w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C413&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C551&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>It really depends on the term length of your financing:</i></b></span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-169796" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=1608%2C674&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1608" height="674" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?w=1608&amp;ssl=1 1608w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=768%2C322&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.40.41-AM.png?resize=1024%2C429&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1608px) 100vw, 1608px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b><i>Another metric to consider is the overlap between your </i></b><b><i>periodic payments and the returns on your investment.</i></b></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For example:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> If you are planning to use your loan to make an equipment purchase, then the equipment you buy might start generating</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">returns immediately. In that case, consider comparing your daily or weekly payment on the loan to the daily or weekly income your investment will generate. That difference represents your net gain from the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the short-run</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Calculating ROI</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Time Is Money:</strong></span> Traditional lenders, like banks, can take weeks to process your business loan application and for you to receive the funds. Short-term online lenders, often have an answer to your loan application in under an hour and funds in your account as quickly as the next business day. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports it takes the average small business owner 33 hours to apply for a loan at the bank.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Considering ROI When You Borrow</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For short-term loans with a defined ROI target, APR might not be as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">important a metric as the total cost of the loan relative to the return on </span><span style="font-weight: 400">investment. Particularly when purchasing inventory or equipment, the total </span><span style="font-weight: 400">cost of financing might be a relevant number when calculating ROI. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the total cost of financing, in addition to APR, when calculating </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ROI can be a good way to determine if the financing being considered will </span><span style="font-weight: 400">help meet your ROI objective or become too expensive—even with a lower </span><span style="font-weight: 400">periodic payment or lower APR.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Calculating ROI – Let’s Make it Simple</b></span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some business owners are concerned the with higher periodic payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400">often associated with a short-term loan. If your business has the cash flow to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">sustain the payments, the lower total dollar cost of capital can be cheaper, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in the long run, with a short-term loan. Even if the long-term loan has a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">lower periodic payment or a lower APR.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>EXAMPLE: <span style="color: #000082">How Can a Short-Term Loan Affect My Cash Flow?</span></b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>A laundromat buys 10 new washing machines.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the day they install the new machines, they generate $540 per day ($3 per cycle,180 cycles per day). If they bought the machines with a 6-month loan for $10,000 at 1.19 Cents on the Dollar (CoD), their daily payment would be $95/day. So, over the short-term, their net gain would be $540-$95 (minus the cost of the water and electricity to run the machines).</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-169799 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=1372%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="Short-term Business Financing | OnDeck" width="1372" height="650" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?w=1372&amp;ssl=1 1372w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=300%2C142&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-11.41.21-AM.png?resize=1024%2C485&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Once they’ve made all 126 payments they get to keep all $540 (minus utilities) for the remaining lifetime of the machines. That might be more appealing to some business owners than a loan with a longer payback, because they might be willing to pay more in the short-term in exchange for a greater ROI, faster.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>57% of small businesses choose a shorter-term, higher-APR loan over a longer-term lower-APR loan in order to minimize total fees &amp; expenses*</b></span></h2>
</blockquote>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><b>Choosing The Right Lender</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it’s time for you to make a decision on choosing a lender, there are some things you should consider. </span><span style="color: #ff474a"><b>Here are some Questions you should be asking yourself.</b></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>What do I need the money for?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing the business need the funding will help you with is the most important step in your search for financing. The answer to this question will help the lender get you the right offer, as well as help you make the best financing decision for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>How much money do I really need?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Know the actual amount of funds you need. There are costs associated with borrowing, so borrowing more than you really need can become very expensive. What’s more, not every lender will offer you the full amount you request, and if you have good credit, some lenders may offer you too much.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>How quickly do I need the money?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you need the money tomorrow, this week, or next month? The time frame in which you need the funds can drastically cut or shape the options that work for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>What types of financing can I qualify for?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your personal credit score, business credit profile, cash flow, time in business, annual revenue, and several other factors are all considered by lenders to determine the funds and terms you will qualify for. Know the minimum requirements for each lender before you put in an application. That way, you won’t waste your time applying with lenders that won’t work with your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><b>Do I have all the information I need to make a decision?</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The simplest way to know you’re getting the best financing for your business is to have all of the information beforehand. Do your research, so you spend your time applying with lenders who will lend to you and will meet your business needs.</span></p>
