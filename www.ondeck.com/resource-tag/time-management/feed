			<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Article Summary<br /></strong>Social media can be a great tool for your small business.

<p>Your business knows social media is important, but where do you begin? Digital advertising revenue, driven by networks like Facebook, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/03/advertising-trends-2017.html">expected to increase 18 percent</a> year over year to reach $229 billion this year. Social is where the people are, where they’re consuming media, where they’re interacting with friends and getting recommendations, where they’re looking to discover new brands and products that fit their needs, and so much more.</p>
<p>Where your business spends its time and money can get out of hand without strategy. Here are some ideas for how to focus your efforts on the right networks, using the right tools, to save your business money and improve return on investment.</p>
<h4>Use Built-In Network Applications</h4>
<p>Even if your small business doesn’t have the budget to work with an agency on social media or hire someone full-time in-house to handle it, the good news is that networks are free and most have built-in reporting tools to provide you with insights. Some, like Facebook, even offer scheduling features.</p>
<p>When it comes to the social media networks your business should be on, here’s a look at some you might consider:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>Facebook: </strong>The big daddy of social networks, the site has 1.94 billion monthly users, with more than 68 percent of adults using it. Considering its large market share, Facebook should be the number one priority for B2C businesses to have a presence on. You can share photos, videos, text updates, slideshows and more, and schedule posts ahead of time within the Facebook app. The site has rich reporting features built into every business page profile, including info on when your users are on the site and how many people interact with each post.</li><li><strong>Twitter: </strong>Twitter has 328 million monthly users, which may seem to pale in comparison to Facebook, but it’s important to realize some of the most important people to your brand are often avid users on the network: journalists, bloggers and influencers. The platform gives brands the capability, unlike Facebook, to directly message any user who follows the brand page. This makes it easier for your business to build relationships with influential users and get more press. The network also has a free analytics tool that shows top Tweets and followers.</li><li><strong>Instagram: </strong>Powered by Facebook, Instagram is key for any visually-minded brand like a restaurant or clothing store. With 700 million monthly active users, businesses that can shine visually through photos or videos should have an Instagram. An Instagram account is essential to brands in verticals like fashion, hospitality, food and beverage, and art, but any business can use the network to show off company culture or re-share posts from followers to engage with consumers. Instagram business users get a free insights tool that shows follower demographics, follower growth and impressions.</li><li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> Pinterest has 150 million users, and like Instagram, it’s a great way for visual brands to get noticed through "pinning" images on vision board-like displays. The network skews heavily female, with <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45 percent of online American women</a> using the network compared with 17 percent of males, so if your brand targets women, you might consider setting up a profile here. Brands with a free business account get free analytics on Pinterest, showing top posts, audience details and stats about your profile.</li><li><strong>YouTube: </strong>Not everyone uses YouTube in a social sense, but with 1.5 billion monthly users, the power of the channel can’t be ignored. If you plan to produce videos, YouTube is key, because you also get the added benefit of keyword-optimized videos showing up in Google search results, the network that owns YouTube. You can also interact with user comments, comment on other videos to connect with more users and add other videos to your own page to build up content if you don’t produce your own. You can schedule videos in advance through YouTube, and YouTube’s analytics provide insight into demographics, traffic sources and watch time.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>A few other social networks your business might consider include:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>LinkedIn: </strong>A haven for B2B enterprises, LinkedIn is still a good place for B2C brands to have a presence because there are more than 500 million users on the network. You can post business updates, encourage your staff to grow their personal brands by interacting in LinkedIn Groups, and use free LinkedIn analytics to gauge what type of content works best for your business on the network.</li><li><strong>Snapchat:</strong> If your B2C targets teenagers and millennials, you should consider Snapchat. More than 60 percent of American smartphone users ages 13 to 34 use the social network, which has 161 million users. Photo and video content does well here, which “self-destructs” from the app after 24 hours, making it a great place to share special offers.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Now that you have a better idea of what networks you could be on, here’s how to use these networks to boost revenue.</p>
<h4>Get Organized to Align Social with Sales</h4>
<p>Top brands save time and money by aligning marketing strategy with sales efforts. It seems like a no-brainer to tap into sales objectives and campaigns to power marketing, yet some brands lack a social strategy and then wonder why they’re not getting results.</p>
<p>A content calendar can help streamline your efforts. Agora Pulse and other similar tools, offer a free editorial calendar template. You can map out your entire business year with your sales team in the room. Discuss product launch dates, plans for holiday specials and seasonal trends where certain products should be spotlighted. Use the calendar as a guide to plan your social content, but be flexible enough to adjust content by checking in with sales on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>One brand that boosted its sales initiatives with social is a company I worked with as a consultant a few years ago. They were a local nursery trying to compete with much bigger big box store competitors. They had been in business for many years and had amassed a very complete catalog of advice they shared in article form with customers who visited their store. When I advocated sharing the advice on social media with an offer to meet with a gardening expert who could help them with their particular landscaping or gardening questions, they were not only skeptical, but they though they would be giving away what set them apart from the big box—real, honest to goodness, expertise.</p>
<p>They decided to give it a try. For the next three months we promoted this advice via their blog and their Facebook page. We included an invitation to come into the store and visit with one of the gardening experts about their yard or their garden. The education content shared on social media was so successful, they had to make managing that effort a full-time job for one of their employees—they had that many people visiting the store with questions and ultimately becoming customers.</p>
<p>They have since expanded this effort on Instagram with beautiful images of flowers and garden plants with tips for planting season and other useful information.</p>
<h4>Automate Social Media Posts</h4>
<p>Instead of your social media manager, or whoever’s in charge of social at your startup, having to manually log in to every single social network to post, schedule them all at once in one tool. This way, if you want to have an editor or second pair of eyes view them, they can do this all at once.</p>
<p>Here are three social media automation tools you might consider:</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<ul><li><strong>Agora Pulse: </strong>AP is a great tool that we use here at OnDeck. We love it because it’s such a simple, intuitive platform. You can use it to easily schedule posts for all of your social channels and listen to conversations happening around your business or industry. Their measurement tools are straightforward. Most importantly for a small business owner, you do not need to be a social media maven to utilize this product.</li><li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Similar to Agora Pulse, this social scheduling platform allows multiple users to access various channels and messages within one platform. Besides the scheduling, Buffer has stellar analytics that track engagement, impressions and account performance. The free platform allows two profiles and 10 scheduled posts per profile, while paid accounts increase the more users and platforms there are.</li><li><strong>CoSchedule: </strong>In addition to offering a social media scheduling tool, CoSchedule enables article scheduling and blog post management, plus scheduling for marketing projects. It provides more transparency into the various arms of a marketing department, to help you align your strategy. Plans with social scheduling start at $40 per month.</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>Using fewer tools for scheduling and reporting saves more of your team time. But how do you know what to pay for?</p>
<h4>Social Media Shopping Tips</h4>
<p>The great news is, all of the tools mentioned above, and many more, offer free trials so startups can see what works best for their team and business needs. Take advantage of these trials by having your employees test them out. Pepper customer service members of each tool with questions as they come up, so you can see how responsive they’ll be when you have problems in the future and how much help they can offer. Before you start the trials, come up with metrics you’ll use to measure just how much time your team is saving, through ease of use and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Ask your staff to reach out to their personal contacts or use forums like LinkedIn Groups to ask others in your industry what they’d recommend. Make social media tools a topic of conversation at your next industry networking event.</p>
<p>You can also request a consultation with each tool’s sales team, so you can explain exactly what you need and see what they offer you. Signing up for a tool can bring it significant revenue over time, and they want your business. Don’t be afraid to let each one know what you want, and have them get to work to show you how they&#8217;ll make the tool work for you.</p>
<p>Continue to ask for input from your team members who end up using the tools once you&#8217;ve signed up, so you can switch services if something is not working. As people get used to working with a tool, they may come to accept frustrations that could be costing you money, so regular check-ins can help keep your team — and your wallet — happy.</p>

<p>Small business owners are often the first to arrive and the last to leave the office. With myriad responsibilities to juggle and being pulled into various directions, managing time wisely is a constant challenge. A report by Inc<em>.</em> found the average employee is truly productive at the office for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/in-an-8-hour-day-the-average-worker-is-productive-for-this-many-hours.html">less than three hours a day</a>. As a small business owner, you can&#8217;t risk falling into this category if you want to stay profitable. Here are four time management strategies small business owners can try to stay more productive.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>RPM</strong></p>
<p>RPM is short for Rapid Planning Method and was created by business strategist Tony Robbins. Robbins calls RPM a system of thinking, rather than a time management strategy. Robbins says alternatively, RPM could stand for Results-oriented/Purpose-drive/Massive Action Plan. Business owners can use RPM to identify a specific goal, reasons why achieving that goal is important and various ways to reach the goal.</p>
<p>Business owners should use the mission and values of the business to create goals that are in line with the vision. Overarching goals can be broken down into projects, which are further broken down into tasks. The emotions and purpose that are propelling the vision and goals help to increase motivation and momentum for the smaller projects and tasks. The RPM helps business owners stay focused and can be revisited and evolved over time.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Chunking</strong></p>
<p>Chunking has long been considered one of the best techniques for memorizing large bits of information. Breaking down massive amounts of info into smaller “chunks” that contain associated items makes memorization easier. Similarly in business, instead of getting paralyzed by a massive to-do list and focusing on whatever is in front of you in the moment, break down large amounts of tasks into more manageable chunks to get things done.</p>
<p>Chunking related to time management involves writing down your daily or weekly tasks, then looking for commonalities among them. “Chunk” those individual tasks together into groups. Dedicate a period of time to accomplishing those. Watch your to-do list whittle away.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Pomodoro</strong></p>
<p>While chunking breaks down your list of tasks, the Pomodoro technique breaks down the time you have to work. It was created by Francesco Cirillo in the early 1990s. Take any large task or series of tasks you have, and get to work on them by dedicating 25-minute, focused intervals to being productive. The Pomodoro technique is often used with a timer, and each 25-minute interval is called a Pomodoro.</p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="">
			<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pomodoro-Technique.jpg" alt="Pomodoro Technique" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>		</div>
		
<p>After working for 25 minutes with laser-like focus, take a short 5-minute break. Then, get to your next Pomodoro. The Pomodoro technique is effective is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical act of winding up or pressing a timer primes you to get in a work-ready mindset</li>
<li>The “ding” at the end of the interval becomes associated with a sense of accomplishment for what you worked on</li>
<li>The short breaks recharge you so that you can continue to be productive during your next Pomodoro</li>
</ul>
<p>Like any time management technique mentioned here, in order for the Pomodoro technique to be effective, all other distractions should be eliminated while you&#8217;re working. That means turning off email notifications and shutting the door.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of 52 and 17</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the Pomodoro technique, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-rule-of-52-and-17-its-random-but-it-ups-your-productivity">the Rule of 52 and 17</a> suggests that productivity increases when you focus on the tasks at hand, and only those, in this case for 52 minutes, then take a 17 minute break. These number of minutes surfaced from a study by the Draugiem Group using time tracking app DeskTime to see what types of work habits increase productivity.</p>
<p>For 52 minutes, the goal is to work with purpose, meaning working to produce great results and to gain accomplishments. Having 17 minutes to take a break allows you to get up and take a walk, which increases endorphins, or eat a healthy snack, connect with a coworker outside your office, etc.</p>
<p>Breaks are crucial to maintaining attention spans. If you&#8217;re not getting the results you want with the Pomodoro technique because distractions keep popping up during the 25-minute intervals, blocking out a longer amount of time with the Rule of 52 and 17 may work better.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make These Techniques Work</strong></p>
<p>RPM, chunking, Pomodoro and the Rule of 52 and 17 only work when you ditch multitasking and completely focus on what you&#8217;re doing. Use these strategies to make any productivity hack you try more effective.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a website blocker. </strong>If you have a habit of checking Facebook every 5 minutes or feel tempted to read world news, use a website blocker app while you&#8217;re working on your tasks. There are plenty of free ones that give you the power to shut off sites and applications while you&#8217;re working.</li>
<li><strong>Block off your calendar. </strong>There is ample data that most meetings are a waste of time. Without focused agendas, when employees are allowed to be late, and when meetings are scheduled to be much longer than necessary, productivity time is wasted. Avoid being pulled into meetings where your presence isn&#8217;t necessary by blocking off calendar time to dedicate to working on tasks that are meaningful to you. As a business owner, you can also help to shape a company culture that makes meetings much more strategic by implementing stand-up-style meetings or creating guidelines that keep meetings focused.</li>
<li><strong>Delegate. </strong>As you use RPM to see the big-picture of your goals and tasks, identify work you can pass on and work that you need to do yourself. This helps you to make better use of your time as you chunk together your tasks, which you can then focus on and work on using Pomodoro or Rule of 52 and 17 techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are countless other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2017/08/29/productivity-techniques-to-try-when-youre-in-a-slump/#27e9ffa32a70">time management strategies</a> and productivity techniques whose principles you can try to see what</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Running a small business is no easy feat – as a business owner, you wear several hats to keep your day-to-day operations running smoothly all while strategizing for your business’ long term growth. But how do you find the time to get everything done? Check out these time management tips from David Bobbitt.</i></p>
<p>In OnDeck’s latest <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/what-would-you-do-with-33-hours-of-your-time-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Main Street Pulse Report</a>, 61% of business owners surveyed told us they’re constantly racing against the clock, 49% said work/life balance is an illusion and 86% said time management is critical to success. So, we’re launching a Time Management Series this week to help you be more efficient, sacrifice less personal time and get one step closer to achieving that elusive work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll hear from David Bobbitt, president of The SCORE Foundation, on his time management tips and work/life balance best practices. <a href="https://core.score.org/ondeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORE </a>is a non-profit organization comprised of 11,000+ volunteer mentors who provide free and confidential small business mentoring and advice.</p>
<p><strong>GUEST POST FROM DAVID BOBBITT:<br />
</strong><br />
At first glance, I am the last person who should ever write a guide for work efficiency. But according to people who know me, I do cover well. So rather than say “hey, here are all the solutions,” read this more as “hey, here are my long list of challenges,” plus some strategies that help me get by.</p>
<p>Big picture first….when you start and run your own business, contrary to expectations, you are simultaneously your own boss and rarely your own boss. By that I mean to do well, you need to enforce discipline around your behaviors. If being your own boss means eating ice cream sandwiches all day while binge-watching Netflix, well let me tell you from personal experience that’s not a good way to grow your business! You get to choose what order you do things in and if and when to get help, but most business functions must occur regularly—bookkeeping, sales calls, inventory, you name it—and those functions are truly the small business owner’s boss.</p>
<p>I had to learn that it was OK to ask for help, a sign of strength, not of weakness. My first business involved renovating and flipping real estate. I was young and stronger than I look. Many times I had to hire people to help me with technical repairs beyond my experience. At first I convinced myself that I would watch them work, say adding circuit breakers to an electrical panel, and learn that task well enough never to need that specific help again. One day—and bear with me because I’m slow—I realized that if I relied on strong professionals who could do part of the job that I’m not so hot at, I could focus on the tasks where my presence is most value added. Which brings me to…</p>
<p><strong>Delegating</strong>. One of the first things a small business owner has to do is to delegate. Now this may not mean hiring employees. Getting help from a virtual assistant, short-term contractor (like my electrician), or a service provider like an accountant can help keep you on track to achieve your goals while still ensuring you get a good night’s sleep on a regular basis. Pitfall to avoid: When you think you are your own best accountant, attorney, electrician, or finance guru—and you don’t have a background in that field—you aren’t! It’s OK to ask for help, and never a sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>. Everyone says that technology helps us be more productive. As Netflix and the video games on my iPad can attest, technology for me often helps me be less productive as well. But let me mention some of the technology-based solutions I use:</p>
<p>1.) Many new business owners are unaware that SCORE offers <a href="https://www.score.org/content/live-and-recorded-webinars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded webinars</a> that can be accessed any time, day or night. We know that many business owners can’t carve out an hour in the middle of the workday to join us for a live webinar, but each gets archived and can be accessed absolutely free. Whether it’s a session about how to access capital or ways to use social media platforms wisely, we cover it all. I can’t recommend these webinars enough &#8211; they’re such a valuable resource and we’re proud to offer them for free. Binge watch and learn!</p>
<p>2.) <a href="http://www.tripcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripCase</a> is an app I started using at my consulting business. It’s great for putting all the components of a trip—flight, hotel, car—in one handy location and it generates calendar items for my calendar. TripCase helps me get the most out of any travel. There are likely other apps out there too that can help, so you should check them out to see which works for you.</p>
<p>3.) <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meet-me-in-the-middle/id826982528?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meet Me In The Middle</a> is a great app when you need to set up meetings or meet with a group of people and want to find somewhere halfway for everyone. Just enter each address, and you can figure out what’s halfway. My business team was virtual, so when we decided to meet, it wasn’t as easy as walking down the hall to the water cooler.</p>
<p>4.) Notes for iPhone is one of the best efficiency products ever. All my Notes are synched, so I can take notes anywhere and always be able to find them again using a simple search from any of my devices. Since my memory is sometimes a bottleneck—don’t laugh, it will happen to you one day too—I like the ease of searching Notes.</p>
<p>5.) Social media marketing tools. This is a good news/bad news item in my book. It’s easier than ever to promote your business through social media and online advertising tools, but truly marketing your company requires attention and great care in developing your brand and message. There’s no way to go through the motions just to get it done, like you could do with bookkeeping or perhaps operational tasks. Developing blog posts, social media content, and other forms of marketing can be cost effective, but can take a great deal of time and focus.</p>
<p>6.) Excel. I ran a real estate business for seven years on Microsoft Excel. It is still my go-to tool for figuring out budgets and making estimates. It’s even easier to use today thanks to quick and easy Excel tutorials available on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong>. When I was deeply into my last business, I was a member of a “CEO support group” of peers. It was one of the best experiences of my life. Every business owner needs a support system — it goes back to seeing asking for help as a sign of strength, not weakness. A support system made up of family, friends, and/or colleagues can prevent you from getting tunnel vision as you work toward your business goals. At the same time, they can help motivate you to complete business tasks you’ve been avoiding. Many new entrepreneurs find their SCORE mentors to be helpful in this regard. A mentor is someone who understands the rigors and stresses of starting a business, but also knows that an exhausted business owner isn’t going to accomplish much. A mentor can provide gentle reminders to business owners to be kind to themselves, while also looking for ways to streamline the small business workload and systems.</p>
<p><strong>Last Word</strong>. I had to learn to become patient with myself, and I urge any small business owner to cultivate patience for himself or herself. A new business owner is overwhelmed with not just the possibilities of entrepreneurship, but also with the long to-do lists required to achieve those possibilities. Get to know your working style and find ways to improve it — and don’t sweat what the books and experts say too much. There are a ton of helpful tips out there, for sure, but not every tip works for every business owner. Don’t get hung up on that. Figure out your own strengths, and play to them. Like me, you may never be a paragon of efficiency. But you can learn to be your best as well as your most productive.</p>
