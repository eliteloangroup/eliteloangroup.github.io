								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As colder weather approaches, individuals and companies alike begin thinking about and planning for the holidays. If you’re among the many business owners who plan to celebrate the holidays with your employees, you’re in good company. You’re also engaging in a smart business practice. As it turns out, celebrating the festive season not only increases good will around the office or factory floor, doing so is good for the company’s bottom line.</p>
<h3>Workplace Satisfaction and Job Performance</h3>
<p>As a businessperson, you may recognize value in keeping your workers happy. Employee turnover is expensive, not to mention disruptive. However, maintaining employee satisfaction also helps your company’s bottom line in boosting productivity. In fact, studies cited by the Harvard Business Review showed that companies experienced <a href="https://www.inc.com/samuel-edwards/examining-the-relationship-between-workplace-satisfaction-and-productivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31 percent more productivity</a> and 37 percent higher sales when employees were happy or satisfied.</p>
<h3>Why Holiday Entertainment Spending Pays Off</h3>
<p>At the height of the Great Recession, many companies cancelled so-called extras such as holiday bonuses and parties. In fact, only <a href="https://www.omaha.com/money/at-least-some-company-holiday-parties-make-a-comeback-after/article_f5713b5c-cdff-5f65-bc57-f009b80c345c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">68 percent of companies</a> responding to an annual survey conducted by Challenger, Gray and Christmas in 2011 planned to hold holiday parties. By 2015, the number of companies that planned to host holiday festivities had rebounded to 80 percent.</p>
<p>There’s a good reason for the upswing. Holiday entertainment spending demonstrates that the hard work and effort employees put in is appreciated. The money spent on holiday parties, bonuses and gifts can be viewed as an investment in maintaining stability among your company’s workforce. Workers who feel appreciated are more willing to put in extra effort when needed and less likely to be shopping around their résumés to look for new jobs.</p>
<h3>Best Practices for Spending the Holiday Budget</h3>
<p>There are five major elements of any get-together: guest list, venue, food and drink, ambiance and entertainment. Many big companies splash out on big-ticket celebrations during the holidays, including celebrity entertainment, all-expense-paid getaways to exotic locations or lavish feasts featuring dancing accompanied by live music and open bars.</p>
<p>However, it is not necessary to break the bank to throw an enjoyable holiday party. If your budget is limited, you can either opt to cut back expenses overall, or limit some areas while splashing out on others. For instance, holding the holiday celebration on company premises incurs few or no additional expenses. However, logistics may be a challenge if your company is large or you plan to host spouses, vendors and others along with your employees.</p>
<p>The guest list for a holiday party is often determined by the nature of the celebration. In-house lunches are often limited to employees, while employees often expect to be allowed to bring spouses to evening events held over dinner. Adding vendors and other non-employees to the guest list also increases costs.</p>
<p>The tab for food and drink for a holiday celebration can be as inexpensive as a potluck lunch or as extravagant as an all-expenses paid, multi-course sit-down dinner along with an open bar and a live band for dancing. Entertainment for holiday parties can also translate into major expense. As a rule, live entertainment is more expensive than pre-recorded tracks spun by a deejay. Ambiance and lighting are often neglected. Fortunately, creating an inviting ambiance is often as simple (and inexpensive) as strategic lighting and well-placed, unobtrusive speakers.</p>
<p>If you intend to serve alcohol at your holiday party, it’s smart to minimize the risk of partygoers driving home while intoxicated. Reserving a block of hotel rooms is a generous option, especially for parties held off premises. Complementary rides home by cab or shared-ride service is a somewhat less expensive option that accomplishes the same purpose.</p>
<p>If your holiday party budget is more generous, an evening celebration where spouses are invited and which features live entertainment and a sit-down meal may be viewed as more memorable by employees. On the other hand, a limited budget does not mean limiting the fun of a holiday party. A catered lunch allows a welcome opportunity for downtime and camaraderie among employees, and between workers and supervisors.</p>
<p>Invitations represent one aspect of a holiday party that involves little or no cost. Online sites such as Evite allow hosts to create secure, private sites for their celebrations, with customized invitations distributed via email or text, and running tabs of acceptances and regrets.</p>
<h3>In-Office Versus Offsite Parties</h3>
<p>In-office parties are often more convenient, especially for lunchtime celebrations <span class="fr-style">—</span> after all, your workers are already there. Parties on company premises also tend to be less formal and more relaxed, which often suits the culture of smaller companies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many larger companies opt to host their holiday festivities offsite, especially if alcohol is served. Many offsite venues include provide food and drink, covering two aspects of your company’s holiday celebration. Offsite celebrations signal that the get-together is social, rather than an extension of the workday, and lend themselves to more formal celebrations.</p>
<p>Informal holiday celebrations provide opportunities for employees at all levels to relate to one another in a relaxed atmosphere. Secret Santa exchanges with preset spending limits or outings to see a popular family-friendly movie are fun ideas for smaller companies. Planning a date to serve meals in a soup kitchen honors the spirit of the season while providing a means for companies of all sizes to give back to others who are less fortunate.</p>
<h3>Tax Implications of the Holiday Party</h3>
<p>While the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated several formerly-allowed entertainment-related tax breaks, some deductions for company holiday parties were left intact. Specifically, hiring a popular entertainer for an evening to entertain vendors is probably no longer eligible for a tax break. However, expenses for parties held for employees and spouses (except for “highly compensated employees”) likely remain 100 percent tax deductible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you love them, hate them (or regard them with complete indifference), holiday celebrations are an undeniable reality of many company cultures. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas — when the silly season hits, work life can seem like a relentless parade of tinsel, paper plates and sensibly casual slacks.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, why do we do it? Do these celebrations serve a deeper purpose? Or are they best simply gotten rid of when the company budget gets tight? Most importantly, if we do keep the holiday traditions, how do you get the best bang for your buck on a limited budget?</p>
<p>Here’s our take on these holiday imponderables.</p>
<h3>Why Have Holiday Celebrations at All?</h3>
<p>It’s a fair question. Let’s face it, while there are going to be <em>some</em> people in any company who live for the next corporate shin-dig, a lot of people regard these events with something approaching disdain. The fact is, arguments about opportunity cost and corporate austerity aside, holiday celebrations are just a very human thing to do.</p>
<p>Sure people might gripe about it, but it brings people together. They provide an opportunity for colleagues to step away from the daily grind and just … hang out as people. It’s an emotional rationale sure, but there’s nothing wrong with celebrating the fact that we aren’t just faceless work droids from time to time.</p>
<p>Setting the feely, touchy stuff aside though, there’s also a very tangible reason holiday celebrations are a good thing. They reinforce loyalty and cohesion and they improve engagement.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup analysis</a> of workplace productivity found that companies with a highly motivated and engaged workforce outperformed rival companies by 147 percent in earnings. Flipping that coin, <a href="https://risepeople.com/blog/employee-engagement-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the estimated cost</a> of a disengaged workforce is between $450 and $550 billion, annually.</p>
<p>Are holiday celebrations the magical ingredient which makes engagement happen? Well, no. However, they are definitely one small part of what keeps people together and motivated to be part of a greater whole.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>holiday celebrations are important, even if you’re on a tight budget.</p>
<h3>Holiday Celebrations on a Budget</h3>
<p>So, if you buy the argument that we shouldn’t dispense with them altogether, how can we make holiday celebrations worthwhile when money is a limiting factor?</p>
<p>The key here is to keep the company eye on the collective prize. Building loyalty and engagement is the goal here &#8211; <em>not </em>opulence or (brace yourself) “optics”.</p>
<p>Here’s three ways to make that happen.</p>
<h4>1. Reinforce a Sense of Kinship</h4>
<p>A holiday celebration is an opportunity to recognize the <em>human</em> experience of working within the company. This needn’t and shouldn’t be heavy handed.</p>
<p>It can be as simple as managers mingling not with a view to “networking” and instead opening up conversations about highs and lows. What was fun these last few months, and what … well … sucked.</p>
<p>On a slightly more nuts and bolts level, getting all staff (rather than the dreaded party committee) involved in decorations and music can be a great way to build a sense of kinship while simultaneously saving costs on DJs and catering. Win win!</p>
<h4>2. Get People Talking</h4>
<p>Making a holiday hootenanny an opportunity for everyone to speak and be part of a conversation also reinforces the idea that we’re all in this together. Again, this needn’t be organized or choreographed. In fact, only the most die hard of extroverts among us likes big group “ice-breakers”. Most introverts hate them.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t find structured low-key opportunities to get people talking. Tables could be set up with trivia or other questions, for example. The room can be set up in a way which encourages different sets of people talking. Managers could even try to introduce people who might not normally talk to one another.</p>
<p>None of this costs money. It just requires encouraging folks to open up.</p>
<h4>3. Be Inclusive</h4>
<p>To build loyalty, it isn’t necessary to wow people with lavish options. But you do need to show that you’ve listened to their preferences. Being sure to give participants the opportunity to express their tastes, dietary restrictions, and family requirements is a big step toward showing them they’re genuinely welcome and valued. In fact, it’ll likely go a lot further than fancy appetizers and drinks with umbrellas.</p>
<p>Getting the best bang for your buck from a holiday celebration may be as simple as spending a bit of time up-front identifying what people <em>actually</em> want, rather than pulling the trigger on a fancy caterer or opulent event location.</p>
<h3>A Few Things to Avoid</h3>
<p>It’s probably worth mentioning a few things to avoid if you’re trying to create a fun and inclusive holiday celebration on a budget.</p>
<h4>1. Avoid Lots of Alcohol</h4>
<p>Most would agree a bit of drinky goodness is fine, but a lot is a) expensive and b) unlikely to produce a memorable experience. Instead of using alcohol as a social lubricant, focus instead on creating a fun and relaxing environment. Good music and good food go a long way!</p>
<h4>2. Don’t Make It Too Formal</h4>
<p>If you do have seating arrangements, find an opportunity to mix it up. Generally, we tribal humans have a tendency to stick within our own cliques. The more formal and structured the party, the more likely that is to happen.</p>
<p>Comfortable, open seating is way better. Make the chairs movable! The more movement and informality you can introduce the greater the likelihood the party will have a life of its own rather than be a stifled, corporate affair.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the cheaper the venue the more likely this is to happen. Lavish party venues tend to breed an air of everyone having to be respectful of the layout. A cheaper party venue or casual home environment reinforces the idea that you can relax and enjoy yourself.</p>
<h3>Try Not To Make It About Work</h3>
<p>This is a tough one! Sure, it’s a work function, but people have plenty of time to talk about work during office hours! It’s a good idea to keep the party a work-announcement free zone.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of a corporate holiday celebration on a limited budget may require a little extra versatility to organize. However, it’s also a great opportunity to focus on what counts.</p>
<p>After all, loyalty and engagement aren’t bought with fancy catering! They’re a result of listening, inclusion and showing that we’re all in this together. And all that good stuff is 100% free.</p>
<p>Happy Celebrating!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not just a Holiday party – a soirée could boost your business profits, too. A study by BrightHR found fun at work increases productivity, reduces absence and lowers levels of stress. Employees who have fun at work are more likely to report feeling committed to their organization and more likely to report feeling creative at work, and they&#8217;re <a href="https://pages.brighthr.com/it-pays-to-play-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less likely to take sick days</a>. A party for your team to celebrate the holidays is a great way for employees to bond and strengthen relationships with coworkers, with positive effects carrying over once employees are back at work.</p>
<p>Throwing the best company Holiday party ever requires thoughtful planning. Here are some tips for putting on a holiday event for your business that employees will remember fondly for years to come.</p>
<h3>1. Plan Your Budget</h3>
<p>Ideally, this step will have happened at the beginning of the work year, so you ensure you have enough to spend come holiday party planning time. You&#8217;ll want to take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of attendees, including if you&#8217;ll allow employees to bring a guest or entire families to the party</li>
<li>Venue</li>
<li>Food and drink options</li>
<li>Decorations</li>
<li>Entertainment</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit.com recommends budgeting at least <a href="https://blog.credit.com/2013/10/office-holiday-party-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$75 per person</a> for a work holiday party. To save money, you can choose to have a holiday party at lunch or on a non-weekend night. You could also work with vendors you have a relationship with to nab a discount, skip an outside venue and hold the party at your office, use an iPod for music instead of a DJ, or implement a whole host of other budget-friendly holiday party ideas.</p>
<h3>2. Ask Employees for Input</h3>
<p>Make employees feel like they&#8217;re a part of the party-planning by asking them what they want at the party. You can use a free survey creator like <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Forms</a> to send out some questions regarding the planning, including the best time to host the party, employee guest policies and venue suggestions.</p>
<p>You should definitely ask for employee feedback regarding the menu. Your employees may have certain dietary restrictions or preferences, so having diverse food that everyone will enjoy is key.</p>
<p>You may also find that familial obligations influence what type of party your employees want. For example, if most of your employees have kids, they might want a party at a kid-friendly venue, so they can save money on having to hire a baby-sitter if they want to attend.</p>
<h3>3. Scope Out Venues</h3>
<p>Where you have your party can make or break its success. Some venues will have professionals working for them to take care of decorations and set-up, while others will give you free reign to decorate (which also might save you money). When looking at venues, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much seating you need</li>
<li>How central the location is compared to where the majority of your employees live</li>
<li>Space for entertainment, like a dance floor or DJ</li>
<li>How the venue can accommodate decorations for a specific theme</li>
</ul>
<p>Some small businesses choose to host a festive get-together at the office. If you are considering this, and you&#8217;re hosting the party during work hours where attendance is mandatory, you must pay your employees for attending the Holiday party.</p>
<p>Also, be aware, if you serve alcohol at an office Holiday party, you open your business up to liability. If an employee is injured at work, you will likely be facing a worker&#8217;s compensation claim. You should take your workplace alcohol guidelines into account when planning any Holiday party, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<h3>4. Determine the Presence of Alcohol</h3>
<p>More than <a href="https://www.millealawfirm.com/workplace-holiday-parties-employer-responsibilities-and-worker-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 percent of businesses</a> will experience an employee lawsuit at some point, according to the Millea Law Firm. Don&#8217;t let your Holiday party put employees or your business in danger. Whether or not to serve alcohol is a key consideration. You want to make the party festive but keep it safe, so keep these factors in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t let employees get drunk &#8211; </strong>One way to avoid this is to work with a licensed alcohol provider. Bartenders should not serve employees who appear intoxicated. You might want to hand out a set number of drink tickets or host a cash bar so employees drink less.</li>
<li><strong>Arrange for transportation &#8211; </strong>You might not be able to get cabs for all your employees, but you could arrange for a discount code for a ride-sharing service like Lyft or Uber. Or, choose a venue that is close to public transportation. If you see that an intoxicated employee is leaving and plans on driving home, call them a cab.</li>
<li><strong>Only serve beer and wine &#8211; </strong>Mixed drinks, or something like spiked punch, make it harder for employees to determine just how much they&#8217;re drinking. If you limit what you serve to beer and wine, it&#8217;s easier to monitor how much alcohol is being consumed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To protect your business further, at any party where you&#8217;re serving alcohol, make it crystal-clear that the party is not mandatory and that no business will be conducted during it. You can have employees sign a waiver where they agree they are liable for their behavior and will accept appropriate consequences, so they&#8217;re more likely to monitor their alcohol use.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Make It Fun and Festive </strong></h3>
<p>If the holiday party is purely for employee enjoyment and not to do any business, make that clear to employees. Include games and activities at the party to help employees break the ice and get to know coworkers they may not interact with regularly. You could also host a raffle with prizes employees are interested in, so they get excited about winning and look forward to the results throughout the party.</p>
<p>Another way to spread cheer at your Holiday party is to set up a photo booth with props. Your employees can take a memory of the party home with them and get creative in their mini-photo shoots.</p>
<p>You also might want to consider a recognition portion for your Holiday party, though it&#8217;s important to not make any employees feel excluded. You could choose silly award themes to avoid competition or bitterness. Or if your team is small enough, you could hand out a meaningful award to every single team member.</p>
<p>Remind employees of office etiquette guidelines before the party kicks off. Employees should be discouraged from bringing questionable gag gifts to a party, or something like mistletoe that could make coworkers feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Once the party is over, send out another survey asking employees what they thought of it. Their responses can help you plan better for next year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #f7f7f7;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> There are a few ways to show appreciation for your employees at the end of the year. For a small business, holiday bonuses are an option, but it's not the only way. </p><p>In this article we'll talk about the pros and cons of holiday:</p><ul><li>Bonuses</li><li>Gifts</li><li>Parties</li><li>Time off</li></ul>		</div>
		
<p>&#8216;Tis the season to show your employees you care. The holiday season bring out the warm and fuzzies no matter which holiday people are celebrating. If you want to join in on the fun and strengthen your relationships with employees, some type of holiday reward can help.</p>
<p>Gallup research finds employee recognition positively impacts employee engagement when the recognition is honest, authentic and individualized. (1) So what&#8217;s the best type of way to recognize employees over the holidays? Here&#8217;s a look at the pros and cons of bonuses, gifts, parties and time off when you&#8217;re considering what your business can offer.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Bonuses for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Holiday bonuses can be based on employee performance or given out at the same amount for all employees. A 2017 report by ABC News found up to 70 percent of employers offer performance-based bonus plans, and 35 percent of U.S. employers offer across-the-board holiday bonuses. (2)</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Bonuses<br />
</strong>When a bonus is performance-based, it can motivate employees to meet the performance standards needed to secure the bonus. Some companies measure performance throughout the entire year before deciding bonus amounts. These types of bonuses can be a powerful way to keep employees performing well throughout the entire year.</p>
<p>Knowing that a bonus is coming can increase employee morale. The National Retail Federation reports consumers will spend an average of more than $1,000 this holiday season. (3) Anticipating a chunk of change that will help alleviate that burden is something employees can look forward to around the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Bonuses<br />
</strong>If you give a bonus one year, employees might come to expect them each following year. If you have to reduce the next bonus or do not provide it in the future, employees can become angry or let it affect their work performance going forward.</p>
<p>Bonuses that are based on performance can also create some negative feelings. For example, if an employee doesn&#8217;t think the bonus they received is deserving of the effort they put forth, they might feel negatively about it. Performance-based bonuses might also create unhealthy competition or resentment among coworkers.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Gifts for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Holiday gifts for employees allow small business owners to get really creative with how they recognize their employees over the holidays. There is no limit on what types of gifts to give, from elegant office-friendly gifts to gift cards.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Gifts<br />
</strong>If you buy certain types of holiday gifts in bulk, you might be able to get a discount. You can also leverage connections you have for gift ideas and potential save money, too. For example, if you&#8217;re friends with a store owner or restaurant owner, they might be willing to give you gift cards for a lower cost.</p>
<p>Some employees might really appreciate gift cards, because they can help with their own holiday shopping or give them the freedom to pick out a gift for themselves they&#8217;ll really love.</p>
<p>If you give personalized gifts, that can make more of an impact on employee engagement, because you&#8217;re showing employees you pay attention to the kinds of gifts they&#8217;d like. A great gift can have the potential to be more meaningful while costing less than some other employee holiday recognition options.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Gifts<br />
</strong>Employees who embrace a minimalist lifestyle or who are already overloaded with the amount of stuff in their homes may not appreciate a gift.</p>
<p>The wrong type of gift could make a negative impact. For example, you might think a beautiful journal is a cool gift for an employee, but the employee may interpret the gift as something meant to be used for work and assign less meaning to it. (4)</p>
<p>You could also even get into dangerous territory with some gifts, like if you give a bottle of wine to an employee who doesn&#8217;t drink alcohol, or you give peanut butter cookies to someone who is allergic to peanuts or is gluten-intolerant.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Parties for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Some employees look forward to an annual holiday party, and others (introverts, ahem) dread them.  The 2018 <em>Holiday Party Survey </em>of 150 human resources representatives across the country found 65 percent of companies plan to host holiday festivities, which is the lowest percentage since 2009. (5) Some possible reasons the report cites for the decline include liability issues regarding sexual harassment and assault at holiday parties, as well as increasingly remote workforces.</p>
<p>No holiday party is fine for employees who get some other form of holiday compensation, since a 2017 survey of more than 1,200 people by Randstad US found 90 percent of workers would rather get a bonus or extra vacation days than attend a company holiday party. (6)</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Parties<br />
</strong>A holiday party is a way for your employees to connect. The Randstad survey found 62 percent of employees feel pressured to attend a company holiday party, so if you want to have a team bonding event where people are likely to show up, this is a good one to host.</p>
<p>Holiday party programming allows for employee recognition in front of employees&#8217; friends and family, which can be really special for employees (or, on the other hand, really embarrassing.)</p>
<p>Planning a holiday party enables your business to connect with other local businesses who might provide services like a venue and catering. This could widen your network in your business community.</p>
<p>A holiday party where employees feel comfortable sharing more of themselves with their coworkers can strengthen bonds back in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Parties<br />
</strong>Holiday parties involving alcohol present challenges. Some employees may not want to come or will not enjoy themselves if alcohol is not present. However, any work event where alcohol is served opens your business up to liability. (7)</p>
<p>You must have alcohol policies in place, including for work events outside of the office. You could make the bar a cash bar where another vendor serves the alcohol, and instruct bartenders to not serve alcohol to visibly intoxicated guests. You could also provide security at any event where alcohol is served and tell employees not to return to the office or use office equipment after drinking.</p>
<p>Seeing employees who are intoxicated is another issue. You have to be prepared for employees behaving differently if they are drinking. Remind them before the event of how that will influence your and their coworkers&#8217; perception of them back in the workplace.</p>
<p>Holiday party costs can add up quickly if you are renting a venue and paying for food, drinks and security. If an employee or employee&#8217;s guest damages a property the blame could be placed on your business and damage its reputation.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also have to be careful when planning the party theme. Your employees might celebrate diverse holidays, so creating an all-inclusive party can be challenging based on diet and which holidays are celebrated.</p>
<h3><strong>Holiday Time Off for Employees</strong></h3>
<p>Time off is the most desirable reward for employees, according to the Randstad survey, which reports 70 percent of respondents named time off as the number one thing they wanted from employers. Time is money, after all, and during the holiday season, there never seems to be enough time to do all we need to.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Holiday Time Off<br />
</strong>While hours or a day off does technically cost your company, it might be less of a hit since other employees can pick up the slack when an employee is gone.</p>
<p>One way to prevent all your employees from taking the same time off around the holiday season is to give time off to be used the following year. This way, all your employees aren&#8217;t gone all at the same time. If your business tends to get slower in the holiday season anyway, you could also consider letting everyone leave a few hours early before the holiday, or adding an extra day or two on to the typical holiday leave.</p>
<p>Since most employees want time off, when you give it your staff, it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ll feel gracious for this gift. Time off is universally useful.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Holiday Time Off<br />
</strong>Your business may already be generous in how much time off you give. Giving more could place a burden on your operations.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t regulate when employees can use the time off, there&#8217;s a chance you might receive multiple requests for similar times.</p>
<p>If you give time off and employees want to use it during a busy time when you need them in the office, denying multiple requests could result in resentment.</p>
<h3><strong>What Gift Will You Give Your Employees This Holiday Season?</strong></h3>
<p>The type of holiday employee recognition that is most cost-effective and meaningful for your business will depend on a variety of factors, like your employee preferences, your business model, and your budget.</p>
<p>Some type of recognition is vital to give, though, since it boosts employee engagement. Businesses with engaged workforces are more profitable, have fewer accidents, have better customer engagement, and have better productivity and retention compared to those that don&#8217;t, Gallup reports. (8)</p>
<p>Try surveying your employees before the holidays about what type of recognition they&#8217;d want the most. You can host an anonymous survey using a tool like Google Forms to gain insights. (9) When you pay attention to what employees want and then deliver it, you&#8217;re giving more personalized and effective holiday recognition.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">401(k) for small businesses are often only seen as a large cost &#8211; a fear that is not entirely unfounded. Historically, traditional providers catered their products, as well as their pricing, toward larger companies with bigger budgets and more assets. And, even if a smaller company could afford the financial piece, the sheer overhead of administering a plan was too much to take on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, the days when plans were prohibitively expensive are over. By automating administration, providers are able to keep costs down to about half that of a traditional provider, and far less than a single employee&#8217;s health insurance! Now more than ever, the benefits of offering a 401(k) far outweigh the costs, especially because the costs are coming down drastically. It serves not only as an incredible employee benefit, but also comes with special tax incentives that small business owners can get from offering retirement plans to their employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Technology is making retirement saving easier than ever. Companies like Human Interest reduce the time burden and keep costs low by focusing on administrative efficiency. Managing investment accounts requires not only financial insight, but also a system for managing the funds, keeping up to date on legal requirements, withdrawing the money each pay period, and a process for employees to access their accounts to help you and your employees make sound financial choices for your retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, retirement plans are also a great way to recruit and retain employees to help drive success. Giving employees amazing benefits is one of the best way to ensure they’re happy, remain loyal to your company, and want to help you make it succeed. In fact, according to a recent Forbes article, having happy employees contributes to higher profits, as much as 22.2% as shown in data from the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For. So, since many employees cite retirement options as one of the primary benefits they seek when deciding where to work, offering it to them can contribute to higher work satisfaction, help you reduce turnover, and even help your business make more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, 401(k)s can be a great way to diversify. You never know what will happen or when your business will struggle. It’s important for business owners themselves to save money by starting a company-sponsored retirement plan for themselves and their employees. That way, everyone’s hard work is rewarded because everyone can prioritize their retirement savings throughout their working lives. Retirement savings are meant for the future, so even if you experience variable income or business troubles, retirement accounts remain solid as long as they aren’t touched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And let’s not forget about all the money you and your employees save and gain on tax-sheltered investments until retirement. The money your employees put into savings before taxes are taken out of their paychecks. Then, when they retire and start withdrawing money from their 401(k)s to live on, they will be taxed at an income tax rate versus a capital gains tax rate, which is far better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The best bonus for businesses, though, is that they can get a tax deduction for contributions to their employees&#8217; retirement accounts. Want to be extra generous? Set up a top-notch 401(k) plan by giving employees a match and get a bigger tax deduction. If you match part of your employees’ contributions to their retirement plans, you get to deduct those contributions and help your employees grow their savings. Plus, since you are your own employee as well, this means that you can match your own contributions too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Technology has reduced a lot of the tedious administrative work around starting a 401(k) and paperwork  along with it the overall cost of providing a retirement plan for your company.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I sit here staring at my screen, fighting with my internet to stay online, (because that’s just going to be my day today) I realized that many people, me for example, are going through summer withdrawal and struggling to get back to work mode. It should hit a scorching 92℉ today in New York City, so the fact that school’s back in session and the lighter summer traffic is behind us is a bit mind boggling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I chatted with my colleagues this morning, many of them felt the exact same way I do. They long to still be on the beach, spending time with their family, or just sleeping in late like they did over the long Labor Day weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may be asking, “Why is my reluctance to accept summer’s impending end relevant to business owners across the nation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My colleagues and I represent a fair age range and different stages of life, likely similar to you and your employees. We are all dedicated to our jobs and, from what I can tell, enjoy coming to work&#8230;most days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For many people (business owners included), this week can be a struggle to get back to your usual 110% mental capacity. As a business owner, the thought of losing productivity to daydreaming isn’t very appealing. So here are 3 easy things you can do</span> <b><i>today</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to get your employees out of their summer haze and jumpstart their month.</span></p>
		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #000082;">
			<ol><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="color: #ffffff"><b>Schedule a coffee pow-wow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Put 30 minutes on everyone’s calendar to meet in the kitchen or the break room and give them time to grab coffee, chat, and get summer out of their system. Acknowledge the issue and hit it head on with a quick "thanks for being here" chat and some caffeine to help get your team out of the clouds and back to work. </span></span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="color: #ffffff"><b>Send a summer’s end email:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Write a quick email outlining all the great work the company accomplished this summer and what you’re most excited about for the rest of the year. Your team will see how much they’ve done and it will give them a moment to reflect and take it in.</span></span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="color: #ffffff"><b>Share your company goals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Take the opportunity to publicly spell out the company goals for the next month or the rest of the year. No matter your industry, be it an auto-body shop, a restaurant, or a spare parts wholesaler, seeing the company goals connects employees to the bigger picture and encourages people to focus on making them happen.</span></span></li></ol>		</div>
		
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hope this helps! As for me… just getting back into the swing of things like typing this article one word at a time took me from dead asleep to fully functional in about an hour. I’ll take that as today’s big win. Buh-bye summer, see ya next year!</span></p>

<p>Like many business owners, it&#8217;s likely you are constantly seeking ways to save money on operating expenses, <a href="https://www.ondeck.com/resources/create-plan-managing-employee-expenses-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including payroll</a>. One area where many employers target is paid time off. It is a truism that providing paid time off, especially paid sick leave, is costly. While this may be an understandable approach, denying paid sick leave for your workers is a penny wise, but pound foolish policy that will likely cost your business money in the end. What&#8217;s more, providing paid sick leave for your workers benefits your company’s bottom line in ways you might not realize.</p>
<h3>Less Absenteeism</h3>
<p>The flu season of 2017 and 2018 was one of the worst in recent history. A particularly severe strain of the flu (H3N2) reduced the effectiveness of the flu vaccine; that and widespread infection (46 states as of January 2018) combined to create nearly a perfect storm. Another factor that almost certainly made matters worse was a unavailability of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 28 percent of all civilian workers — approximately 45 million Americans — do not have access to paid sick leave. If they take time off from work, their paychecks suffer. They may even risk losing their jobs. The result is a phenomenon known as “presenteeism” — people reporting for work who should be home in bed, or even in the hospital. It is a widespread occurrence. According to a July 2016 report co-produced by NPR, The Robert Wood Foundation and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, every week 1.5 million Americans who do not have paid sick leave go to work when they are sick.</p>
<p>In a confined environment like an office, a single sick employee can infect an entire staff, with some becoming so ill that they cannot come to work. Multiply this occurrence by thousands of sick people riding public transportation, interacting in public places and working in food-handling or health care environments. It doesn’t take much effort to comprehend how an epidemic can reach potentially debilitating proportions. On the other hand, providing paid sick leave — and encouraging workers to use it — not only allows sick workers to recuperate, it also reduces the risk of your other employees missing time due to illness.</p>
<h3>Better Morale</h3>
<p>Many employers resist efforts to raise minimum wages and impose paid sick leave, but often change their minds once such policies have been put in place. The reason is simple: their fears of employee abuse and escalating costs have largely proven to be unfounded. For example, San Francisco has mandated paid sick leave since 2007. However, the median worker only takes 3 of 5 allowed sick days each year, and 6 out of 7 employers reported no significant detrimental effect on profitability.</p>
<p>At the same time, morale among workers increases significantly in workplaces with employee friendly policies such as paid sick leave. About 30 percent of employers in Connecticut reported improved morale among their employees as a result of the passage of a paid sick leave law.</p>
<h3>Reduced Employee Turnover</h3>
<p>At the height of the Great Recession, there were more than 6 applicants for every job opening. In that environment, employers felt free to demand more productivity from their employees while holding down wages and cutting back on perks like paid sick leave.</p>
<p>However, by 2013 the ratio had fallen to 2.9 job seekers to every opening and has continued to fall. In the resulting tight labor market, employees are naturally more likely to seek better working conditions, and employers have begun to respond accordingly, including those in the traditionally low-paid service sector. For instance, in January 2018, Starbucks announced that it would provide paid sick leave for all its salaried and hourly employees in the interests of improving working conditions and reducing employee turnover.</p>
<h3>Increased Productivity</h3>
<p>Sick workers are less productive than healthy workers. It may seem obvious, but many employers fail to realize the financial benefit they stand to gain from adopting a paid sick leave policy. According to a study cited by the New York Times, lower productivity from sick workers on the job costs employers as much as their medical care. In other words, employers aren’t saving any money by encouraging (or demanding) their workers to report to work when they’re sick. On the other hand, providing paid sick leave for your workers not only means less “presenteeism” but also allows workers to address acute conditions such as dental problems while they are relatively minor.</p>
<h3>Lower Risk to Your Customers or Clients</h3>
<p>Companies with employees in public-facing jobs or businesses affiliated with the medical or food industries especially stand to benefit from providing their workers paid sick leave. Workers in these situations who feel compelled to come to work while they are sick may spread infectious diseases that are not only detrimental to their colleagues but also place the general public at risk.</p>
<p>Providing paid sick leave is not just a “nice” benefit for employers to provide for their workers. It’s also smart business policy. Morale, productivity and the bottom line all benefit when workers are allowed to stay home when they are not feeling well, without risking their jobs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[		<div class="rc-call-out" style="background-color: #e0e0e1;">
			<p><strong>Article Summary:</strong> Depending upon the nature of your business, it's likely you have employees who are authorized to make purchases or incur other expenses on behalf of the company. Effectively managing employee expenses is important for your business, your employees, and your bottom line.</p><p>Here are four things you should consider to manage employee expenses:</p><ol><li>Establish an accountable expense reimbursement plan</li><li>Develop a transparent outline to manage employee expenses</li><li>Create a user-friendly expense report</li><li>Manage employee expenses with company cards</li></ol><p>Continue reading to learn more about managing expenses.</p>		</div>
		
<p>Not having a clear policy for managing employee expenses for your business could spell trouble for your employees, your management team and your company&#8217;s bottom line. Employees may overestimate what they&#8217;re spending and demand reimbursement. You could be paying for items that in no way benefit your business. Employees who don&#8217;t get paid what they feel they deserve can get angry with your company and talk about it negatively to peers.</p>
<p>Having a defined strategy and documentation to support it protects your business. Just consider the impact a simple travel policy has on employees. A 2016 study by the Global Business Travel Association found for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gbta.org/foundation/pressreleases/Pages/RLS_111516.aspx?Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egbta%2Eorg%2Flists%2Fnews%2FAllitems_all%2Easpx">79 percent of business travelers</a>, the company policy had the most significant impact on their travel decisions, more so than convenience or cost. If you build it, your employees will have to follow it. Use these tips to optimize employee expenses while keeping employees and clients satisfied.</p>
<h3>Get an Accountable Expense Reimbursement Plan</h3>
<p>An Accountable Expense Reimbursement Plan is a business plan that complies with standards set forth by the Internal Revenue Service, which allows your business to reimburse employee expenses on a tax-deductible basis. Expenses that fit within the plan must have a business connection and may include travel expenses, including meals and entertainment, as well as supplies purchased for business. Employees must report their expenses to you within a set amount of time, and any excess reimbursements that are greater than the allowable amount must be returned. You can find more information and how to report on these plans <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch06.html">here.</a></p>
<p>As a business, you aren&#8217;t required to turn in every employee receipt to the IRS, but you must retain documentation for at least three years in case there&#8217;s an inquiry. The IRS will want proof that you have a plan in place for employees, which brings us to the next step.</p>
<h3>Develop a Transparent Outline to Manage Employee Expenses</h3>
<p>Your employee reimbursement plan should be transparent and accessible to all employees. An ideal place to store this for employees is in an employee handbook or policy and procedures manual, and make sure it&#8217;s up-to-date in each edition. You should also store the most current policy online where it&#8217;s easily accessible. It&#8217;s wise to consult with your compliance department when creating the policy to make sure the policy is legal and fair to employees.</p>
<p>A thorough policy for employee expenses should include a purpose, scope, payment type, details of exactly what qualifies for reimbursement, details of what will not be reimbursed, explicit direction to contact the employee&#8217;s manager or the human resources department before spending if there are any unanswered questions and how employees should file for reimbursement. The policy should also state what items need to be pre-approved before they&#8217;re purchased, such as significantly costly items like plane tickets. You can delve deeper into costs for each item, such as the maximum amount someone can spend on meals in a single day while on a business trip.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to dive into details. You might have different policies for different positions in your company, since employees across departments may be interacting with varying levels of clientele. It&#8217;s better to provide more information than cause confusion or a case where an employee feels like they have not been fairly reimbursed. Recruiting software Workable has a sample policy you can download and edit for your own business <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.workable.com/employee-expense-company-policy">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Create a User-Friendly Expense Report to Help Manage Employee Expenses</h3>
<p>The best expense reports are easy to understand for employees who use them and are simple for your accounting department to process. Accounting software Patriot Software has a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patriotsoftware.com/accounting/training/blog/expense-reporting-policy-example/">basic expense report template</a> and recommends including tracking for purchase date, item bought, purchase amount, advances given and reimbursement total. Smartsheet has created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smartsheet.com/free-expense-report-templates">expense report templates</a> for multiple categories. You should model your expense reports after your policy and keep them as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Store the expense report on a company hard drive or cloud location for easy download whenever an employee needs it. You can also add in some reminder language on the report about when it should be turned in, such as, &#8220;Please submit this report to accounting within 30 days of purchase.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Manage Employee Expenses with Company Cards</h3>
<p>If you have one, a few or many employees who are consistently spending money on business affairs for your company, supplying them with company credit cards may save your business hassle in expense reporting and give you perks in travel or cash rewards. Not only do company credit card purchases ensure accuracy and provide easy record-keeping, certain credit card companies may offer businesses rewards based on usage and purchase amounts. If your business is constantly flying people around to meet with clients, travel rewards could amount to great savings for your company.</p>
<p>Also, employees may appreciate being able to use a card rather than have to dip into their own checking or savings accounts for up-front business costs. Keep in mind, you&#8217;ll want to limit employees who get their own company credit cards to those you trust. Anything the employee spends on the company credit card will be paid by your business, and both the business&#8217;s and the employee&#8217;s personal credit histories will be evaluated before a company credit card is granted.</p>
<p>Again, if you decide to offer certain employees access to company cards, there should be a written policy in place, that is approved by your compliance department, to protect the usage of the cards. The policy should cover what happens if the cardholder uses the card to purchase personal items. Even if this happens accidentally, the policy should include how to rectify situations such as these.</p>
<h3>Prepare Wisely to Protect Your Business</h3>
<p>Your business capital is perhaps your most significant asset to staying afloat as a startup or growing business. In order to safeguard it but still enable employees to successfully make the purchases they need for your business, create clear and thorough policies and guidelines. Whenever employees are spending business money, whether for future reimbursement or on a company credit card, work with your legal team to create policies that keep your business protected. Then, consult with accounting to create expense reports that are easy to use and that make your employees&#8217; jobs easier, too.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the top five determining factors of successful startups is mastery of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sage.com/na/~/media/site/sagena/responsive/docs/startup/report">the latest marketing tactics</a>. Fliers and radio ads no longer cut it in a world dominated by search engine optimization, social media marketing and content campaigns. Startup success depends on visibility, powerful word-of-mouth referrals and connecting your product or service with the best potential customers. In other words, hiring the right marketing specialist.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s obvious that marketing is essential, how do you make the best hire? Here are four questions to consider for for hiring a marketing specialist for your small business:</p>
<p><strong>What Are My Marketing Goals?</strong></p>
<p>Part of what you should include when writing your business plan is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/write-your-business-plan/marketing-sales">a market analysis</a>, recommends the U.S. Small Business Administration. By examining who your potential competitors are and identifying their successful marketing strategies, you&#8217;ll have a clue about where you want to outshine them or areas they&#8217;re neglecting. If you&#8217;re a fashion boutique, for example, you might want to adopt the loyalty purchase rewards program of a comparable brand. Furthermore, if you notice that your top three competitors&#8217; blog are lacking, you can focus on search-engine-friendly, helpful blogs that influencers will love to share.</p>
<p>Your plan should also flesh out marketing and sales strategies. The two departments&#8217; performance will influence each other, so be prepared to have enough sales to support your stellar marketing efforts. A thorough marketing strategy should include sections covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market penetration, or reaching new customers</li>
<li>Growth, which could include both expansion of product sales, as well as expansion of the business</li>
<li>Distribution channels, from selling services or products in-house, to using retailers and distributors</li>
<li>Communication, including public relations and digital channels</li>
</ul>
<p>As a B2C startup, communication should be a major focus of your marketing strategy. Determine your top campaign priorities, your ideal marketing achievements and ways to measure those campaigns before you hire.</p>
<p><strong>What Is My Marketing Budget?</strong></p>
<p>If your marketing budget has not yet been set, determining your objectives in your business plan gives you and any funding stakeholders something tangible to work with when deciding on an amount to dedicate. Entrepreneur<em> </em>magazine recommends that startups that are one to five years old dedicate between <a target="_blank" href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243790">12 to 20 percent</a> of projected revenue to marketing, since creating awareness is so vital in the early stages. A grand opening launch party for your restaurant, for example, will require a bigger budget early on.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve determined your magic marketing number, you&#8217;ll want to keep in mind what percentage of that total will go toward any paid media spending and what you&#8217;ll use on people power. A mix of both paid and organic outreach should be considered. In realms like content marketing and SEO, keep in mind that results take longer to cultivate but can have a greater pay off. While a paid Google ad will get eyeballs on your website right away, a blog post that gradually builds up readership over a year may turn into a top search result that consistently refers traffic to your site and that requires no further investment.</p>
<p><strong>What Skills Are Desired when Hiring a Marketing Specialist?</strong></p>
<p>Your marketing goals and the expertise you already have within your team will help to determine the skills you&#8217;ll need to fill in with your marketing department. Because global e-commerce sales are expected to experience double-digit growth through 2020, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Worldwide-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-Will-Reach-1915-Trillion-This-Year/1014369">reaching $4 trillion</a>, many of the marketing skills startups require today are digital-focused. Even if the focus of your startup is products sold at a brick-and-mortar location, your potential customers are looking for your services online.</p>
<p>April Dunford, a startup marketing and sales consultant, says the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rocketwatcher.com/blog/2012/04/startup-marketing-job.html">most common skills</a> your competitors are likely seeking out from candidates include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content creation &#8211;</strong> including blogs, webinars, infographics and slideshows, plus public speaking presentations</li>
<li><strong>Social media management &#8211; </strong>which involves working with customer service and quality assurance teams based on feedback</li>
<li><strong>Data synthesis &#8211;</strong> including the ability to test, measure and optimize marketing initiatives, and clearly explain results to key stakeholders</li>
<li><strong>Public relations skills &#8211;</strong> including the competency to conduct outreach to influencers within the startup&#8217;s industry and garner press, both print and digital</li>
<li><strong>Email marketing &#8211;</strong> including copywriting, graphic design strategy, execution and measurement</li>
</ul>
<p>Some marketing initiatives, like email marketing or paid Twitter ads, will require an additional budget for campaigns or software costs. If you have already decided on the marketing tools you want to use, such as Hootsuite for social media management or MailChimp for email marketing, you&#8217;ll want to find candidates who are already familiar with those systems.</p>
<p><strong>Where Can I Find the Best Candidates?</strong></p>
<p>Successful startups benefit from team members who are invested in the startup vision and who will work diligently to make it a reality. Hiring a full-time employee in-house means you&#8217;ll have someone who is steeped in the company culture and is aware of all developments as they&#8217;re taking place. Keep in mind that, when benefits and insurance are factored in, hiring a full-time employee can be more expensive than hiring a consultant, contractor or agency. Other times, having an agency&#8217;s full team of creatives working on your campaigns can be far more expensive than hiring an eager young full-time employee.</p>
<p>Whatever route your choose, finding candidates who are qualified is going to be your biggest challenge, even more so than salary or benefits demands, according to Inc<em>.</em> magazine&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201612/leigh-buchanan/state-of-entrepreneurship-2017.html">2017 State of Entrepreneurship</a> annual report. Improve your likelihood for success when vetting marketing candidates for your startup by using these techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dig into your network &#8211; </strong>Talk to respected peers and businesses about your marketing needs, and ask for recommendations. If they&#8217;re bringing success to a like-minded business, they might be able to help you.</li>
<li><strong>Consider their work &#8211; </strong>Often, marketing experts will have certain verticals they specialize in or types of startups they enjoy working with and have had success with. Look at campaigns they&#8217;ve worked on for other companies to see if they align with yours.</li>
<li><strong>Regard how they market themselves &#8211; </strong>One way to gain insight into a marketing candidate&#8217;s skills is to examine how they market themselves. Do they have a professional website? Do they feature recommendations on their LinkedIn page? Is there anything offensive or that doesn&#8217;t align with your brand that is featured on their social networks? Does a Google search on their name display guest blog posts and media mentions, or does something negative pop up? A successful marketer or agency should have a pristine online reputation if they&#8217;re going to be working with your brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the culture of your startup when hiring, too. If you&#8217;re a young, hip brand, hiring a marketing specialist could mean a part-time millennial employee to give you the opportunity to save on marketing budget while also offering the employee the chance to grow with your company in a full-time position. If you serve a high-end clientele, like luxury resort vacationers, investing in an experienced agency that specializes in hospitality can guarantee your marketing assets are classy and reach the customers you want.</p>
<p>To help increase the chance of success for your marketing team, it is vital to provide them with clear goals and benchmarks to work toward. It is wise not to enter long-term contracts with freelancers or agencies in case you discover their strategies are not working for your startup. Having an employee or employees who are agile and adaptable is an asset that can lead to a more stable and long-term relationship.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff">The Ultimate Work/Life Balance Goal: Your Employee and Employer Guide to the Remote Workforce.</span></h1>
<p>Telecommuting and the remote workforce has been growing since technology has begun to transform our lives.  Along with transformations in technology, we’ve seen an adoption of the remote workforce by mainstream employers with a mountain of stats and information that backup the support for telecommuting.  Employee satisfaction, and increased productivity are credited as the largest benefits, the work from home crowd is definitely shifting how we think about going to work.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #ff474a"><strong><a style="color: #ff474a;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.ondeckfinancing.com/remoteworkforce2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download the Full Color PDF Guide Here</a></strong></span></h2>
<p>That could explain why a greater number of U.S. workers now work from home than at any time in history (excluding, of course, any point in time before the Industrial Revolution, when everyone worked from home). Take a look at the growing trend, as shown by a recent <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/184649/telecommuting-work-climbs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup</a></span></span> poll:<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164611"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164611" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=1131%2C638&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="1131" height="638" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?w=1131&amp;ssl=1 1131w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=1024%2C578&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gallup-poll.png?resize=399%2C224&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Around the globe, telecommuting is even more popular. PGI&#8217;s <em>Global Telework Survey</em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://go.pgi.com/gen-genspec-15telesur-SC1129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirms</a></span> what we all suspect: a whoppingly high number of global workers (79 percent of knowledge workers, in fact) are telecommuters. What&#8217;s more, 60 percent of knowledge workers would drop their current gig in a flash if they could work from home full time.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-10.42.19-AM.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164691"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164691" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-10.42.19-AM.png?resize=1182%2C512&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce ondeck" width="1182" height="512" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-10.42.19-AM.png?w=1182&amp;ssl=1 1182w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-10.42.19-AM.png?resize=300%2C130&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-10.42.19-AM.png?resize=768%2C333&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-10.42.19-AM.png?resize=1024%2C444&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Telecommuting is on the rise, no matter who&#8217;s reporting the stats. Pick your preferred authority: every reputable source from the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span></span> to the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a></span></span> is reporting on this phenomenon.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What&#8217;s the Attraction of Working From Home?</strong></span></h2>
<p>For employees, the reasons for preferring to work from home boil down to a few simple benefits (simple yet overwhelmingly powerful, that is).</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>1. No More Road Rage, Crowded Subways, Traffic Jams&#8230;</strong></span></h3>
<p>The most obvious advantage of telecommuting is no more horrible commute to work. For the more than <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2013/10/ninety-percent-of-americans-drive-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90 percent of Americans</a></span></span> who drive to work, telecommuting represents a total change in lifestyle.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brookings.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164621"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164621" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brookings.png?resize=885%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="885" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brookings.png?w=885&amp;ssl=1 885w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brookings.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brookings.png?resize=768%2C521&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/brookings.png?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>A Huge Percentage of Cars Would Disappear From Roads if Telecommuting Really Took Off</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>2. It&#8217;s Cheaper</strong></span></h3>
<p>According to the American Automobile Association&#8217;s fascinating annual <em>Your Driving Costs </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/auto/your-driving-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a></span>, the opportunity cost of commuting has decreased but it&#8217;s still shockingly high.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164631"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164631" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?resize=850%2C425&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="850" height="425" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?w=850&amp;ssl=1 850w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AAA.png?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>It costs a lot to commute to work, but that&#8217;s only one of the reasons people love telecommuting.</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>3. It Leaves More Time for Life Outside of Work</strong></span></h3>
<p>When we&#8217;re not spending an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://project.wnyc.org/commute-times-us/embed.html#5.00/42.000/-89.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average of 25.4 minutes</a></span></span>  <em>each way </em>on our daily commute to work, there&#8217;s suddenly a whole lot more time in life for&#8230; <em>life. </em>You&#8217;ve heard of the life-work balance? Telecommuting is how you achieve that.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>4. More Time with Friends and Family</strong></span></h3>
<p>We all have friends at work, and enjoy the social gathering, but friends and family are high priority for most anyone.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #ff474a">More than half of all American families have both parents working.  Reducing the commute, and increasing the time at home saves time, money, and energy and allows more time at home with the family.</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164641"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164641" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=847%2C574&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="847" height="574" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=768%2C520&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/workers-with-kids.png?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are endless socio-political reasons that having a parent at home during childhood is beneficial. It’s good for families and it’s good for society. A 1998 <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1998)49:12%3C1115::AID-ASI7%3E3.0.CO;2-Y/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></span></span> found that workers with children rated the stress reduction of telecommuting higher than those without children. In other words, telecommuting means a <em>lot</em> to parents, as well as to their children of course.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Finally, there are a few economic reasons, too, namely that daycare expenses are chipping away at families&#8217; incomes like a hungry wolf might &#8220;chip away&#8221; at a shank of meat.</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5. You Can Take Care of Things While You Work</strong></span></h3>
<p>Got a leaky faucet? A sick dog? A bad cold? Traditional workers would have to choose whether to take care of life&#8217;s little curve balls or trudge in to work. Telecommuters can do both (without the trudging, of course).</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>6. Your Life is Less Stressful</strong></span></h3>
<p>Unless your home life is riddled with stress points and your job is your only salvation for sanity, working from home will reduce your stress levels significantly. Results from studies vary, but some <strong><em>report as high as 82% of remote workers say their stress levels are reduced because they don&#8217;t commute to work.</em></strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What&#8217;s in it For Employers, Though?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, telecommuting has been linked to an actual increase in productivity.</p>
<p>Stanford University Professor of Economics Nicholas Bloom conducted a huge <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://people.stanford.edu/nbloom/sites/default/files/wfh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telecommuting study</a></span></span> in 2011 and found three very important advantages for employers who chose a remote workforce. We’ll show you even more after telling you about his big three.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>1. Save Space and Overhead</strong></span></h3>
<p>With fewer workers, you have lower overhead costs (slash your pencil budget!). Save on supplies, utilities, and even rent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://remote.co/10-stats-about-remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aetna</a></span></span> has anywhere from 14,500 to 35,000 remote workers, allowing them to forgo 2.7 million square feet of office space. The savings? An impressive $78 million! American Express did the same and their savings topped $15 million <em>annually.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0074ff"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco</a></span> started allowing telecommuting and as a result saved $277 million a year. And think of the money you&#8217;ll save in transportation reimbursement.</p>
<p>Plus, since remote employees tend to be more productive and stay longer at their jobs (see the next two reasons), you will save money due to those factors, too. Telework Coalition <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/3-reasons-you-should-let-your-employees-work-remotely-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a></span></span> that the average business saves around $20,000 per year for each individual full-time worker!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>2. Increase Employee Retention</strong></span></h3>
<p>Bloom found that telecommuters were happier with their jobs, and therefore less likely to quit. For employers, that&#8217;s less turnover, which means less time spent training new hires. <em>Cha-ching.</em></p>
<p>A National Institutes of Health <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></span></span> found that telecommuters had higher job satisfaction, better performance, less stress, and as a result, fewer quit their jobs. In fact, some benefits of telecommuting increased as time spent working from home increased. These included such factors as better performance evaluations.</p>
<p>Relationships with co-workers, however, did not improve when telecommuting rates went higher. Nevertheless, the overall effect of allowing workers to work from home seems to be, in study after study, increased job satisfaction and less turnover.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>3. Increase Productivity</strong></span></h3>
<p>Back to Professor Bloom&#8217;s study, which was actually conducted on his own company, a customer service operation in Shanghai. Telecommuters (workers who worked four days from home and one day in the office) were able to handle 15 percent more calls. Overall, they were four percent more productive than their colleagues back  in the office.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the telecommuters also worked 11 percent more hours than their colleagues who slogged into the call center every morning.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Why might this be? Bloom&#8217;s telecommuters:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>took fewer sick days</li>
<li>exercised more</li>
<li>smoked less</li>
<li>took fewer breaks</li>
<li>weren&#8217;t ever late because of commuting issues</li>
<li>were less likely to quit their jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s another case in point: <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automattic</a></span></span>. They are 100% &#8220;distributed&#8221;, which is an insider&#8217;s term for a company with a remote workforce. They run WordPress, one the most-visited websites in the world. Absolutely <em>everyone</em> who works for Automattic does so from home/cafe/wherever&#8230; anyplace but an Automattic office, if there even is such a thing. They&#8217;re hugely successful, and here&#8217;s what their workforce looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-164651"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-164651" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=864%2C483&#038;ssl=1" alt="remote workforce guide" width="864" height="483" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.ondeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/auttomatic.png?resize=399%2C224&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><em>What a Remote Workforce Looks Like</em></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>4. Philanthropic Reasons for Telecommuting</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you care enough about the world outside your business to make changes accordingly, then telecommuting makes sense for several philanthropic reasons, too.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Telecommuting is green. </strong>Less commuting means less car driving, which means less pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting opens up opportunities for rural workers.</strong> Hey, you don&#8217;t have to move to New York any more to get the best jobs (or L.A. or San Francisco or Chicago&#8230;)</li>
<li><strong>Telecommuting opens up opportunities for those with disabilities. </strong>For anyone with mobility challenges, being part of a remote workforce is a godsend.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?articleId=5000107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a></span></span> published in 2009, Cisco reported that their teleworkers prevented over 47,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas from entering the environment. For the workers, that translated into over $10 million saved annually in fuel costs.</p>
<p>So, now you see how having allowances for a remote workforce becomes an act of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>5. You Can Hire the Best, Even if They Don&#8217;t Live Nearby</strong></span></h3>
<p>Here is another reason for employers to love a remote workforce: you can now hire the best employee for the job. You may now expand your search to the outer limits of the earth, if you so desire, in search of the One Perfect Candidate.</p>
<p>No more worrying that you&#8217;ll have to lure someone from another part of the country (or the world, for that matter). You also won&#8217;t have to pay to have a telecommuter relocated. No moving expenses. And telecommuting also eliminates an even bigger worry when hiring from outside your immediate geographical area: all that money spent hiring relocating someone won&#8217;t be wasted if they turn out to be something less than desirable once you&#8217;ve got them there in the office.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>6. You Might Attract More Millennials</strong></span></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of the majority of businesses interested in attracting, pleasing, and retaining Millennial workers, then offering them the option of working from home is a good move.</p>
<p>A survey by <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.aftercollege.com/cf/2015-annual-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AfterCollege</a></span></span> reveals what most of us know via intuition: over two-thirds of Millennial job seekers say that if an employer offers telecommuting options, they are suddenly way more interested in working for that company.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Challenges:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>What About the Notion of the Workplace as the Hub of Creativity?</strong></span></h3>
<p>Hallway chats are supposedly a trigger of creativity in the workplace.  Is that the reality?</p>
<p>The kind of spontaneous interaction that knits together an organization is what many employers fear will go away if they switch over to remote workforces. How will employees exchange ideas, brainstorm informally, bump into one another for impromptu conversations that lead to great things?</p>
<p>In his <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline"><a style="color: #0074ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17396014-the-year-without-pants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a></span></span> <em>The Year Without Pants: WordPress.com and the Future of Work</em>, Scott Berkun writes about all the wonderful ways WordPress (which is 100% distributed by the way) encourages creativity in its employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Berkun can report with authority because he actually went and applied for a job (and got one) at WordPress (run by afore-mentioned Automattic) so he could find out how a company that&#8217;s 100% distributed actually works.</p>
<p>He specifically cites that company&#8217;s use of internal blogs and chat rooms to promote collaboration.</p>
<p>Those and other types of in-person serendipitous encounters will undoubtedly change if you adopt a remote workforce, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be at the expense of creativity and productivity. Yes, telecommuting changes the nature of work-related interaction but it does not have to inhibit creativity.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s software for that.</p>
<p>That brings us to the next section of our guide to telecommuting: the tools used to keep everyone in touch and in line.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff">Solutions:</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #000082"><strong>Tools Are Key</strong></span></h3>
<p>There are a number of fantastic and impressive ways to stay connected, be creative, and share ideas across the web these days, and to cover them all here would not do them all justice. But we&#8217;ll show you a few of the essential concepts to grasp in case you&#8217;re a total newbie to the whole world of telecommuting, cloud-based project management software, and other crucial inventions you may have missed along the way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start by erasing any misconceptions some of you may still have about the right and wrong way telecommuters stay in touch. If there&#8217;s one take-away to this &#8220;Tools&#8221; sections, it&#8217;s that you must move beyond email.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Email- Use Sparingly</strong></span></p>
<p>Email is NOT the telecommuter&#8217;s best friend. It may have been an essential component of the telecommuting dreamscape as imagined by mid-1990s tech geeks planning the remote workforce revolution of the future, but things have changed since then.</p>
<p>Basically, using email to communicate, share documents, and disseminate important information in 2016 is like commuting to work on an ox. It&#8217;s just so terribly clunky and slow, unmanageable an un-nimble that it&#8217;s downright painful to imagine anyone would choose such an outdated form of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">transportation </span>communication. You might as well just go into the office for all the inconvenience and antiquity of using email for doc sharing, organization, and communicating.  There are several great options for collaboration and communication software for the distributed remote workforce.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0074ff"><em>If you use email to share documents, you might as well start commuting again. In an ox cart.</em></span></h3>
<p>Instead, today&#8217;s real telecommuters use a potent mix of Skype, internal blogs, social media, and chatrooms plus of course project management software to keep things humming along with their remote workforces. Here are a few of the most important tools you should know about.  Some favorites include Hipchat, Slack, Basecamp, and other similar software for a variety of necessary project management and communication tasks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Communicating</strong></span></p>
<p>Facetime, GoToMeeting, and Google Hangouts are great options for staying in touch with remote employees (there are tons more, but those are some of the most common). They&#8217;re all tools which can help managers connect with their teams in efficient ways that keep pathways of communication open. You see a face, you talk in real time, and it’s almost like being in the room with your employees.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><strong>Managing Tasks</strong></span></p>
<p>There are countless productivity software packages, many of them cloud-based. One is Asana, and there&#8217;s also BaseCamp, Teamwork, and more, offering the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>calendars</li>
<li>scheduling</li>
<li>Gantt charts</li>
<li>discussions</li>
<li>shareable notes</li>
<li>activity streams</li>
<li>file management</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>webinars, video tutorials, help articles, and user guides</li>
<li>mobile app</li>
<li>milestones</li>
<li>issue management</li>
<li>project pathways and due dates</li>
<li>project prioritization</li>
<li>project timelines</li>
<li>individual team member task lists</li>
<li>reporting</li>
<li>chatting</li>
<li>commenting</li>
<li>assigning tasks</li>
<li>notifications</li>
<li>email integration</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, project management software can be integrated with third-party software packages like Dropbox, Google Apps, Salesforce, and others.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>What About Performance Metrics?</strong></span></h2>
<p>For employers, telecommuting employees’ means striking a balance between workers&#8217; autonomy and accountability. Managers can&#8217;t simply measure hours of butts in seats like they used to. They&#8217;re pretty much forced to look purely at productivity, or output.</p>
<p>That can in itself be a boon to efficiency and productivity&#8230; measure that!</p>
<p>One way to do that is using tools like Harvest, which allows for employee time tracking and individual goal-setting. Another component of a successful remote workforce is trust. Productivity is largely a product of motivation, so knowing how to keep your workers happy is one way to see to it that they&#8217;re doing their jobs at home.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>When Telecommuting Might Not Work: Weak Company Culture or Bad Times?</strong></span></h2>
<p>When a business is in trouble, telecommuting may not always be the best idea. At least that was the reasoning behind Yahoo’s Former CEO Marissa Mayer&#8217;s ban on telecommuting in 2013.</p>
<p>Her now-infamous ban was a desperate pitch to shore up morale, improve productivity, and keep the ranks together in the face of impending possible doom.</p>
<p>At the time of Mayer&#8217;s controversial ban, Yahoo was spiraling downwards fast. Part of her solution was to gather the ranks and hunker them down to work under the watchful eye of management. In a statement from Yahoo Human Resources at the time, the reasoning was explained this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff474a"><em>&#8220;To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home. We need to be one Yahoo, and that starts with physically being together.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff474a"><em>-Jackie Reses, Yahoo&#8217;s human resources chief</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, if your company suffers from low morale, weak company culture, or bad management, allowing telecommuting may be a recipe for making a bad situation worse. That wouldn&#8217;t be the fault of telecommuting per se, but rather just more fallout from a bad company scene where dysfunction is just too pervasive to allow for optimal conditions for anything, much less allowing part of the workforce to remain at home for work.</p>
<p>Ms. Mayer may have been totally wrong about workers feeling connected at work, however. A Harvard <span style="color: #0074ff"><u><a style="color: #0074ff" href="https://hbr.org/2012/08/are-you-taking-your-people-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a></u></span> found that a surprising 87 percent of workers who worked from home actually felt <em>more</em> connected. Their secret? Video conferencing. They may have also benefited from the fact they weren&#8217;t working for a company that was spiraling down the drain faster than you could say &#8220;Yahoo&#8221;.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0074ff"><strong>Recap</strong></span></h2>
<p>It seems the likelihood of offering your work force the ability to work from home at least part of the week can benefit everyone involved. For all the misgivings about remote workforces, it even seems they work harder to communicate, be productive, and create company culture&#8230; something <em>every</em> company can appreciate.</p>
